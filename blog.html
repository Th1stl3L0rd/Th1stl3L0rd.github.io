    <h1>The Obligatory First Post</h1>
    <h5 class="articleDate">June 13th 2025</h5>
    <p class="articleFirstP">
        Well, it  had to happen, didn’t it? You can’t very well start a blog without
        an initial  post, can you? Hmm… I suppose you could skip the first post and
        proceed to the  second, but then you might lose count along the way. Carry
        the seven, remainder  of two- that sort of thing. Eventually you end up with
        an assortment of articles  that make no sense whatsoever and you spend the
        rest of eternity playing catch  up and wondering who’s in first place… It
        reminds me of Hilbert’s paradox of  the Grand Hotel (Infinite Hotel
        Paradox), something we’ll discuss later, I’m  sure. But enough of that. I’m
        supposed to be writing out this Brilliant Obligatory  First Post after all.
        I can’t just ramble on for the next nine hundred words,  or how every many
        are left….
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve just  checked, and wouldn’t you know it, I was actually, very nearly,
        almost quite accurate  with that word count! I didn’t have to carry anything
        heavy at all. Well, we’re  down to roughly eight hundred at this point.
        What’s that? Oh! I suppose I  should have mentioned that before now. My
        sincere apologies. Yes, I have  decided to keep each post to roughly one
        thousand words as a bit of a challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
        “What  sort of challenge?” you ask warily.
    </p>
    <p>
        Well,  obviously there will be a great deal of effort involved in keeping
        the number  that low for someone like me. I’m neurodivergent after all, and
        my AUDHD says “NO!  YOU MUST WRITE DOWN EVERY. SINGLE. LITTLE. DETAIL. THEY
        MUST HAVE ALL OF THAT  INFORMATION, OR HOW WILL THEY EVER KNOW WHAT YOU’RE
        TALKING ABOUT!” Yet another  topic for discussion at a later date.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, how  many words are left now…
    </p>
    <p>
        Well,  look at that! We are past three hundred already. I suppose I really
        should  begin writing about something proper, or you’ll leave the page to
        save yourself  from a terrible migraine. I can just hear you now, “What is
        so difficult about  writing something, <em>anything</em> at all for an
        introductory post?!” Hopefully  you won’t stumble into paroxysm along the
        way. Just take a deep breath and continue  reading. I promise a decent topic
        eventually.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now where  was I…
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh, yes!  The topic of discussion for this Incredibly Brilliant Obligatory
        First Post. Alright,  here we go…
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve  decided to give you all a little background into who I am and what I
        do…
    </p>
    <p>
        Hmm…
    </p>
    <p>
        Once  again, I suppose it must be rather obvious from the blog title. Well,
        it’s  true. I’m queer, and I’m a hermit. Now, I know some of you are shaking
        your  heads and scoffing at my words. “Hermit? Surely not. No one is really
        a hermit,  are they?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yes!” I  say to you. Some of us truly are hermits, for whatever reason.
        More on all that  later as well. Anyway, I’m getting off topic again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of  you are saying to yourselves, “But, you said you were going to talk
        about being  a queer hermit. Isn’t that what you’ve just begun telling us?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Yes. I  started to tell you all about that, but my prose is being hijacked
        by itself. I  may not get it back. So, let’s see…
    </p>
    <p>
        We are  now more than five hundred words into our post, and I’ve told you
        two things  about myself. Firstly, I’m queer. Secondly, I’m a hermit.
        Everyone got that bit?  Good. So now we can move on to the details.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will  find that many of my posts ramble, but hopefully it’s a nice
        little andante-of-a-stroll  through my AUDHD-riddled mind. I will have
        future posts about neurodiversity as  well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hmm… I  should be telling you about the types of posts I’ll make, shouldn’t
        I? That  will help you decide whether this is the right blog for you. So
        where do I begin  with that. There are lots of potential ways to get through
        this, but I think I  need to take the direct approach and just hit you all
        over the head with it.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will be  blunt with the serious stuff and whimsical with the mundane. So,
        I guess that  means I need to get the serious stuff out of the way first.
        Are you ready? Here  goes…
    </p>
    <p>
        FREE  PALESTINE!!!!!
    </p>
    <p>
        Are you  still reading?
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh, good.
    </p>
    <p>
        We’ve  gotten past the first little hurdle. If you can stomach the truth
        thus far,  then we’ll get along just fine. So, yes. There will be a lot
        about social  justice in this blog eventually. And make no mistake about it,
        much of it will  be Palestine related. If you haven’t woken up to it yet,
        you can use this blog  as a steppingstone to your future in helping to
        liberate the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whoa! That  was a bit more serious, wasn’t it? Well, we’re not finished yet.
        I could quite  literally write for hours on end about the injustice, but I
        did set myself a  goal on a mere one thousand words for each post, and we
        are rapidly coming up  on that.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, you’ve  had a peek at the serious side, now let’s get back to the
        whimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will  attempt to write a blog entry at least once a week, however, I am a
        very busy  parent of young and highly precocious children, so yeah, we’ll
        see how well  that works out. As a very busy parent – I spend about 99.99%
        of my time with  them, and the other .01% is spent trying to sleep (hmm…
        that can’t be right.  Where’s the time for blogging going to fit in? I guess
        I’ll need to carry a few  remainders)- I put my kids first. ALWAYS. So,
        yeah. Future posts might be a  little inconsistent, but I’ll do my best to
        keep up the pace.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh, my!  We’ve nearly reached one thousand words! I told you we’d get there
        in the end.  And you learned a tiny bit about me along the way. Well, I
        suppose that wraps  up my Most Amazing, Incredibly Brilliant, Obligatory
        First Post. I hope you’ve  enjoyed our little journey today. Bye!
    </p>
    <p>
        (Damn it  all! I went over the count by sixteen words! Oh, now it’s
        twenty-seven words! I’ll  just shut up, then the number will stop climbing.
        But it’s still climbing,  because I keep writing! ARGH!)
