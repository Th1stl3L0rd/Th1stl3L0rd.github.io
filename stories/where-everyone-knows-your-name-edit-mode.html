    <div id="mainStory">

        <p id="firstP">
            Fred Weasley was a <em>very</em> clever young man. He was  calculating,
            perceptive, enterprising, and above all, highly ambitious with a flair  for
            mischief. However, most of these wonderful qualities were entirely
            overlooked  by those who knew him, and he was quite often simply referred to
            as a <em>Troublemaker.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            From the time he and his twin brother, George, were the  tender age of two,
            they could topple any semblance of order in their home. They  ambled about
            leaving chaos in their wake, much to the chagrin of their poor,  desperate
            mother as she chased after them while shouting and pulling out her  rapidly
            greying hair.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the age of three, Fred and George became the eye of the proverbial
            storm, unfolding upon the world around them. First within their own back
            garden, and then as they grew older still, into the surrounding landscape
            where  they spent many hours running rampant through Ottery St. Catchpole.
            Fred and  George discovered lots of good hiding places and collected many
            specimens for  their on-going experiments, honing their skills before they
            went off to  Hogwarts and became the stuff of legends.
        </p>
        <p>
            With all their mischievousness and determination, was it any  wonder that
            they should become proprietors at eighteen, of one of the wizarding  world’s
            most promising joke shops? Everyone seemed to agree that they were good
            lads with the right idea, and even their mother had to concede their
            success,<em>eventually</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Weasleys’ Wizard Weezes.
        </p>
        <p>
            For anyone not immediately taken in by the shameless  alliteration, the shop
            front certainly turned their heads. The displays were  bright and showy, as
            flashy as freshly minted galleons, and in this way secured  the twins’
            reputation practically overnight. Both young and old would gather in  droves
            to marvel at the wonderous contrivances and eagerly purchase a multitude  of
            products that guaranteed their satisfaction. They were never disappointed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Laughter reined chiefly in their wake, filling them up completely  and
            following them all the way home. Something to shield them against the
            tempestuous  shift between good and evil, and the rise of dark power once
            more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Such uncertainty.
        </p>
        <p>
            Such fear and hopelessness.
        </p>
        <p>
            And Messrs Weasley, knowing full well that they could be  targeted for
            encouraging such optimism, spared themselves very little time worrying
            about it. It was all just for laughs. They never considered themselves
            courageous, never a shining beacon to weather the storm. But in the end,
            that’s  just what they were. And it showed. Their mirth and their
            resourcefulness kept  the wizarding world steadfast, even as they were
            forced to close the shop and  go into hiding. They would not be deterred
            however and continued to use their  voices to bolster the people and carry
            them through until the Final Battle at  Hogwarts.
        </p>
        <p>
            And it all started with Canary Creams and Fever Fudge. Clever,  clever boys.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, when the opportunity presented itself, Fred Weasley did  not hesitate in
            acquiring his own pub. A sleepy little place tucked away from,  but within
            sight of Everything. Oh, how he loved it! His pride was visible in  every
            detail, even the most menial of tasks benefiting from his constant
            attention. And rather than feeling exhausted by the weight of it all, Fred
            was emboldened,  keeping his establishment forever in tip-top order. There
            were floors to scrub,  tabletops to wax, bar stools to bolster, lamps to
            light, glasses to fill,  nibbles to garnish, and customers to chat with
            endlessly about absolutely  nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            And while they waffled on as he hummed and nodded  occasionally, Fred was
            able to indulge in his favourite pastime of all,  polishing mugs. With a
            delicate microfiber cloth and a little elbow grease- such  a silly muggle
            term- even the most roguish glassware would shine like Waterford  by the
            time he was finished with it. The act of polishing each mug so carefully  in
            front of said patrons was <em>decidedly</em> <em>not</em> for the benefit of
            any  convenient eavesdropping.
        </p>
        <p>
            The best part though, as far as Fred was concerned,
            <em>
                the  very best part
            </em>
            , was being stationed at the bar passing a freshly polished  pint or tumbler
            across the glistening walnut countertop. The seamless glide of  low
            friction, glass whispering against wood. Flickered candlelight caught
            amidst deep facets, starbursts dancing all around. It was simply lovely to
            behold, and all thanks to the countless hours spent pampering that chocolate
            and honey coloured surface with Manchurian Tung Oil. Yes, Fred Weasley loved
            his  pub very much.
        </p>
        <p>
            He needn’t do everything by hand, of course, which he <em>didn’t</em> unless
            the mood took him. After all, Fred was once a fully qualified wizard  with
            nearly two O.W.L.’s to his name, capable of charming away the chores
            whenever he pleased. But the satisfaction he got out of doing it
            <em>
                the muggle  way
            </em>
            was unbeatable. Even his forays into lock picking and other non-magical
            enticements couldn’t contend with this.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred finally understood what his mother had meant about it  building
            character, and all those times the persnickety Filch had wheezed and
            cackled at him during detentions. If he were still among the living, he
            would  thank them for their constant tirades and apologize for their near
            fibrillation  at his expense. Alas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, Fred Weasley never truly appreciated manual labor until <em>after</em>
            the day he died. It had made so little sense beforehand. Why would  he want
            to waste his breath and his livelihood dusting the mantle? There were
            toilets to be blown up and prefect’s badges to steal. Inventing and still
            more  inventing. Oh, the practical jokes! He missed it. He missed
            <em>
                them
            </em>
            . He  missed George most of all. But Fred had his pub and his patrons whom
            he was  proud to call friends, and if things weren’t quite the same as
            Diagon Alley or  The Burrow, well… it was close enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were obvious differences for sure, one of the more  favourable being a
            lack of hangover in the morning, which he did<em></em>not miss in the
            slightest. Another great element was the suppression of negative  thoughts
            and emotions. It wasn’t perfect by any means, but for the most part  all the
            people here were relatively- Fred’s favourite pun- <em>light spirited</em>.
            It was like coasting on a gentle waterway, with only the odd rock or two
            disrupting the current, and perhaps, a boulder for the occasional rowdy
            individual. And even if these things were <em>otherworldly</em>- Fred’s
            second  favourite pun- this place still embodied that familiar warmth he had
            come to  expect from home. Home. His new home here in The Beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
            Readying his wits for the next session of chin wagging, his  eyes roamed
            about the pub and all its well-kept belongings. Bright splashes of  colour
            were visible from every angle of the room. Matcha and Mint chevron  parquet.
            Raspberry Yogurt and Lime Custard recessed Queen Anne ceiling. Exposed
            brick walls with random patches of Red Leicester and Grilled Tomato
            hexagonal  tile overlay. And that was just the structure itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were Blueberry and Banana bar stools, Pomegranate and  Tangerine
            tables, Strawberry and Lemon dishware, Mango and Grapefruit Juice  ombre
            serviettes, and even a lavish Mulberry snooker table tucked away beyond  the
            richly-carpeted lounge full of squashy armchairs of every colour
            imaginable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Coupled with the Pear and Butter wall sconces and their  Tractor Beam and
            Lightsaber Blue flames- charmed, of course- the entire pub was  drenched in
            an eclectic zeal that beckoned to even the most timid passersby.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moths to a flame.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was brazen. It was garish. A post-modern palette that  clashed terribly
            with the oft-muted surroundings. But it was Alive with the  memories of
            things past and the susurrus of future’s promise. Intriguing…  alluring…
            nearly impossible to ignore. And once you stepped over the threshold,  you
            never wanted to leave again.
        </p>
        <p>
            It took a moment to adjust to the brilliance of the place,  not least of all
            the dynamic persona of one, Fred Weasley, with his faded  denims, hot
            Magenta t-shirt, and spiky, flaming ginger hair. However, once accommodated
            to the universal loudness of the room, it gave way to an infectious sense of
            calm that left the patrons feeling as naturalized as a grindylow to an
            aquarium.
        </p>
        <p>
            George would have approved of the colour scheme immensely  and quite
            probably fallen about with cacophonous laughter at the thought of  their
            mother’s consternation. Irritating her was <em>definitely</em> one of the
            highlights of Fred’s life. Even in death he still chuckled occasionally over
            her reaction to things like <em>You Know Poo</em>. Yes, he thoroughly
            enjoyed the  benefits of driving her mad, of driving anyone mad for a good
            laugh.
        </p>
        <p>
            Initially, it had been the idea of a new joke shop that took  hold of him.
            Something to help pass the time of forever. However, somewhere  along the
            way, he discovered that his interest in people had evolved. He not  only
            wanted to entertain them but uplift them as well. He wanted to give them
            the atmosphere of togetherness, of community. Something that could envelop
            them  when the vastness of eternity became overwhelming. This prospect left
            Fred  feeling cathartic in ways he never knew possible before.
        </p>
        <p>
            That’s why he chose the pub. His pub. The Cosmic Cask. A  continuation of
            the Weasley Enterprise made available exclusively for the  afterlife. Time
            well spent with good sherbet and great friends in peaceful surroundings.
            Reassuring and familiar. A place where everyone knows your name.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred decided to leave behind <em>most</em> of the pranking,  though. George
            was much better suited for it, being among the living. However,  there was
            still call for a good joke now and then when the regulars became  restless,
            and Fred, ever the consummate schemer, never disappointed them. He  had
            plenty of time for thinking up devious plots after all.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even now, as he prepared to open the pub for the day, he had  the beginnings
            of something wicked forming in the back of his mind. He chuckled  to
            himself, wondering how he’d ever convince a giraffe through the door.
            Perhaps that one would best be filed under the ‘slim possibility’ category.
            He  shook the thought loose and stared at the far wall for a moment,
            refocusing his  efforts on the chores.
        </p>
        <p>
            No matter how often he looked about the place, Fred never  failed to notice
            just how much was there, but at the same time <em>wasn’t</em> there. The
            floor, the ceiling, the walls, the fittings and furniture, even the
            Ploughmans’s and pork scratchings were ever so slightly blurred around the
            edges. An ethereal whisp that would catch at the corner of his eye and
            gently  remind him that they were all part of a greater
            <em>something,</em>whatever that  might be. He rather enjoyed the illusion
            and sometimes when he fancied it,  would pretend he was only just sleeping.
        </p>
        <p>
            But there was no time for a kip now, otherwise he’d have a queue  to deal
            with out front, and that would be wholly unprofessional on his part.  Fred
            swished his wand through the air and with a faint click the door was
            unlocked.
        </p>
        <p>
            He reached for a fresh pint glass and began polishing it  when the door
            opened and an immaculately well-dressed man in his mid-thirties  stepped
            inside. His dark, curly, perfectly coiffed hair fell to his shoulders,  the
            luxurious sheen of each strand playing against the lamp light. His silver
            eyes were bright and complimented his flawless, youthful skin. His black
            leather jacket was zipped halfway up, a delicate charcoal T-shirt peeked out
            from underneath, and his well-fit black denims left hardly anything to the
            imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Sirius, bang on time. The usual, I presume?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “You know me too well, lad.” The sound of his dragon-hide  boots clipped
            against the hardwood and the chain at his belt clinked every few  strides as
            he swaggered towards the bar. His usual seat was waiting for him,  one down
            from the left-end, nearest the door. Sirius lit gracefully onto the  stool
            just across from Fred, placed his hands atop the shining surface separating
            them and grinned wickedly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred chuckled, presenting the man with a tall, black, and  foamy potable.
            “I’m sure there’s still plenty of little secrets to suss out,  mate.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius grinned further at that, showing off his bright smile  before sipping
            his pint and placing it back on the reflective counter with a  contented
            hum. “Ah, excellent as always.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred couldn’t help but notice the sharpness in Sirius’ eyes.  Something was
            up. “Alright, spill the Tea.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “What Tea?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “The Tea, that’s got you so excited, you todger. What’s  happened to put
            such a look on your face since yesterday?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh, that. Well…” Sirius leaned forward, bracing his forearms against the countertop
            and quirking his lips. “It’s something that will require
            Ogden’s, I think.” he said, waggling his eyebrows.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Already? You’ve barely touched your stout.” Fred eyed him  with mock
            suspicion as he continued polishing the mug in his hands.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius scoffed. “Well, not just this moment, lad.” He feigned  incredulity
            at such a presumption. “Let a man finish his drink properly, first,  before
            you go on plying him with the hard stuff.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “As if that’s ever difficult with you.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I am not a drunkard.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Never said you were, mate.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I just enjoy the odd drink, is all.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred hummed at that while Sirius took another sip of his  stout.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I enjoy not getting completely rat-arsed even better,  though.” Sirus
            added. Another lovely <em>perk</em> about this place.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Not completely, no.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius frowned playfully. “Just what are you implying, kid?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Don’t call me kid, Sirius.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “You very much are though, lad.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I’m an adult. Not a kid, not a lad, not a boy. When will  you stop treating
            me as such?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “When you grow up.” Sirius laughed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred rolled his eyes at him.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was often like this between them, and Fred enjoyed their  playful banter
            more than he cared to admit. Sirius was a lot like George in  some ways and
            it saddened him to realize that this was as close as he would ever  get to
            having a conversation with his brother again. Luckily, such thoughts  abated
            quickly and without much lingering distress. No more than a distant  memory,
            sharp edges dulled with time.
        </p>
        <p>
            “So…” Fred pressed, “the Tea?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh, right! Well,” Sirius began, leaning back properly on  his bar stool
            once more, “I’ve got a good feeling about today.” His eyes danced  as he
            clapped his hands together, rubbing them in earnest.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>A good feeling, eh?</em> “Really?” Fred chided. “Are you  sure about
            that? The last time you had a hunch you lost quite a bit of dosh.” He
            brought out his best bottle of Ogden’s Old and placed it before the
            titillated  man, wondering just how long it would take before he’d be asked
            to pour.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius produced a grin that could have rivaled his own once,  and it was at
            times like this that Fred wished perhaps they could have been  chums at
            school. Oh, the mayhem that he and George would have caused together  with
            the help of <em>this</em> Marauder.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Something big is happening, and I think I know what.”  Sirius chuckled and
            sipped his stout again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred just shook his head and began polishing another glass,  wondering if
            Sirius was right.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pub door opened once again, and a beautiful green-eyed  woman and her
            scruffy-haired husband entered, both smiling warmly at the familiar surroundings. They were rather young  looking,
            perhaps only twenty or so, but they carried with them an underlying
            maturity that could best those twice their age. The man took his wife’s
            traveling  cloak and placed it next to his own on a wall hook, as she
            proceeded to brush  several strands of her long flowing red hair from her
            face. The raven-haired  man straightened his large, round glasses, pushing
            them further up the bridge  of his nose, before taking his wife’s hand and
            heading towards the bar. Both  patrons raised their eyebrows as they passed
            Sirius on the way to their seats,  glancing up at Fred who continued to
            polish the glass with a smirk.
        </p>
        <p>
            “You wouldn’t be talking about my son again, would you, love?”  Lily asked
            with only a hint of mockery in her soft voice. Her delicate hand  stopping
            briefly on Sirius’ shoulder and giving it a gentle squeeze before  nodding
            at Fred in greeting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred returned the nod. “Does he ever talk of anything else? He’s sure
            that ‘<em>today’s the day’</em>.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Again, mate?! You really are obsessed, you know that?”  James laughed and
            clapped his best friend on the back. Glancing up at Fred with  knowing eyes
            he chuckled, “The usuals, please.” Reining in his mirth, he and  Lily took
            their seats to the right of the seemingly eccentric pureblood man as  they
            awaited both their drinks and the impending outburst.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I am not!” Sirius barked. “This has been a long time coming  and it is <em>
            definitely happening today!</em>” He stabbed the last three words  into the
            bar top with the tip of his index finger. The passion was practically
            oozing out of him as he glanced sideways at his smirking friends. “Look, I
            might be wrong occasionally, but I know something powerful is culminating. I
            can <em>feel</em> it.” He grasped at the air around him with both hands. The
            young couple simply stared at him. Their lack of enthusiasm was quite
            irritating.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lily gave him a sympathetic smile. “Sirius, don’t you think  it’s a little
            too soon? I mean he’s only just-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Nearly twenty-three years old, Lil! He’s been free from  that disgusting
            Old Moldy for almost five years now. He needs to live his life!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes, but what about-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I know, I know.” Sirius groaned, then took another sip of  his stout. “I
            should be happy for him, being married and starting a family and  all that
            but, we both know-”
        </p>
        <p>
            Lily raised her hand to silence him. “Now, Sirius. We surely  do
            <em>
                not
            </em>
            know how this will play out. Just because it is written doesn’t  mean it
            can’t change. And as I’ve said many times before, he seems content with  the
            way things are at present.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “At present.” Sirius murmured into his pint glass. He  momentarily sulked
            before glancing up into those emerald-green eyes of the  woman that stole
            his best friend’s heart ages ago. “Lil…”, was all he managed  before giving
            up, she would brook no argument from him. That wouldn’t stop him  from
            having the last word, though. “If anyone has the right to be <em>truly</em>
            happy, it’s Harry!” and he went right back to sulking.
        </p>
        <p>
            James, wishing to placate the godfather of his only child,  opened his mouth
            to offer sympathy to Sirius’ protestations when the pub door  opened yet
            again.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Good day, everyone.” said the familiar, crooked-nosed  gentleman.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Good day, Albus.” they replied in unison.
        </p>
        <p>
            A supercentenarian in his own right, Albus Dumbledore had a  presence about
            him that exuded calm yet calculating fierceness as he surveyed  his fellow
            patrons with his bright blue eyes behind half-moon spectacles. His Silver
            and Starlit robes swayed delicately as he approached the bar, a magnificent
            complement  to his white hair and beard, which was so long, he could have
            tucked it into  his sash if he were so inclined.  His  soft smile and
            twinkling gaze fell upon them as he took his usual seat to the  right of
            Lily, just beyond the corner bend. He studied the sulking young man at  the other
            end of the bar, wondering if today would be the day that Sirius Black was
            proven right.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a moment of silence, he turned his attention to Fred. “Am  I correct
            in thinking that our Sirius is attempting to place another fabulous  bet on
            one of this establishments long standing pools?” he asked casually.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Like clockwork, Albus. Of course, when isn’t he sporting?”  Fred replied,
            wondering if Sirius would take the bait. The noble Gryffindor  just stared
            into his diminishing pint with furrowed brows.
        </p>
        <p>
            Albus chuckled and brought both of his unblemished hands  together atop the
            counter. “Perhaps another pint will cheer him up?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh, he’s already decided on Ogden’s for company.” Fred  tapped the bottle
            before him.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Really? Then things must be serious.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “No. He’s Sirius.” Fred supplied with a jerk of his head  towards the man in
            question.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh, ha bloody ha, kid.” Sirius snipped, placing his empty  pint on the bar
            top, and flicking his hair over his shoulder. He crossed his  arms over his
            chest and pouted at nothing in particular across the room.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Now, Padfoot. Don’t get tetchy.” James chided, placing his left  arm around
            the other man’s shoulders and hugging him closely. “After all, we’ve  heard
            the same from you a thousand times before. Calm yourself and have another
            drink.” He gestured to Fred for the Firewhiskey.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred passed a tumbler filled with three cubes of ice and a  generous double shot of
            amber liquid over to James, who was doing his best to pique  the interest of
            his petulant friend. Sirius was a stubborn man, but in the end,  he snatched
            the glass from his best mate and held it firmly to his chest.  Sometimes,
            Fred worried that alcohol might not be the best solution, but as it  never
            did any real harm to his patrons, he was rather forgiving of himself when
            it came to appeasing them.
        </p>
        <p>
            And speaking of alcohol, “Oh, that reminds me Albus, I  invented a new one
            only this morning, if you’re game?” Fred asked, quirking his  eyebrows.
        </p>
        <p>
            “If it’s anything like the last drink Fred, I will be more  than happy to
            assist you.” Albus said, eyes twinkling with delight.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Wonderful!” Fred turned to the sideboard behind him and  reached for
            something the others could not see. When he was standing in front  of Albus
            once more, he held up his right hand indicating a small yellow sweet
            nestled between his thumb and forefinger. In his left, he held a large empty
            cocktail glass.
        </p>
        <p>
            “A sherbet lemon?” Albus inquired, steepling his fingers  atop the bar.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh, but so much more.” Fred beamed. He placed the  confection into the
            bottom of the glass and poured a generous amount of  well-shaken Cîroc over
            it. In very little time the sweet began to  dissolve and turn the
            translucent alcohol into a brilliant, glowing shade of  yellow. It frothed
            and bubbled up, threatening to spill over the top, but then  it appeared to
            have had second thoughts about the whole thing and returned to  just below
            the rim. The wonderful scent of fresh lemons permeated the room as  the
            concoction continued to gently fizz inside the glass, and without
            hesitation, Fred pressed the still-glowing drink forward for Albus to
            examine.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bespectacled man considered the enticing liquid  carefully, raising the
            glass and holding it before his perceptive gaze. Not  dissimilar to a young
            child pressing closely to a shop window at Yuletide,  Albus was lost to the
            sight of the little fizzing bubbles as they danced about  inside. They rose
            to the surface hypnotically before gently popping, several  droplets leaping
            higher than the others in their wake.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a muted chuckle he inclined his head towards the young  barkeep.
            “Cheers.” he said, then took a generous sip. Albus hummed his  appreciation
            as he returned his drink to the shining countertop before folding  his hands
            together once more and nodding his head in approval. “Excellent,  Fred. I
            must say that this drink even surpasses the last. What do you call it?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Sherbet Lemon.” Fred answered with a grin as he began  polishing another
            glass.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Of course,” Albus nodded, “the best solutions are often the  simplest.”  He
            took another sip and  chuckled again before turning to the still pouting
            younger man down the bar. “You  should try this one, Sirius. It really does
            taste like a sherbet lemon and it  fizzes all the way down to your toes.” he
            said, indicating his half-empty glass  to his former student.
        </p>
        <p>
            “No, thank you, Albus.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Are you sure?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I know how much you dislike sweets, but I can assure you  it’s not the
            least bit cloying.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “No, I don’t want-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Just a sip, then. It won’t hurt you.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “No. Thank you.” Sirius stressed, trying his best not to sound  insulting.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Well, it was worth a try, anyway.” the wizened headmaster  sighed, then
            chuckled. “You haven’t changed a bit. I can still  remember
            vividly your protestation of my various attempts with Bertie Botts and
            Cockroach Clusters during your numerous visits to my office.” Albus inclined
            his head towards Sirius, his piercing, bright blue gaze unwavering as a
            small  smile crept onto his face.
        </p>
        <p>
            “You know, boys,” he said at last, not taking his eyes off  Sirius, “I don’t
            think I ever had a set of troublemakers quite like you in all  my years of
            teaching.” He finally looked at James, who seemed to be blushing at  the
            reminder. “At one point, Argus came to me complaining that you would need a
            second drawer for all of your offences.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “A <em>second</em> drawer!” Fred gaped at Sirius,  half-polished mug and
            cloth forgotten. “George and I never got a second drawer.  How did you
            manage it?” he asked, awestruck.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius snorted. “I guess we were just better pranksters than  you, lad.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred’s face fell at that declaration and James took pity on  him. “Well,
            technically there were four of us. Twice as many as you and George.  So,
            it’s to be expected, isn’t it?” The redhead smirked and resumed polishing
            his mug.
        </p>
        <p>
            “You didn’t need to tell him that, James. His head’s big  enough as it is.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Not as big as yours though, mate.” James chuckled.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius rolled his eyes and finished his whiskey.
        </p>
        <p>
            Albus merely nodded at them and continued his conversation  where he left
            off. “Are you sure you won’t try this, my boy?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Quite.” Sirius pushed his empty glass back towards Fred. “I’ll  just have
            another Ogden’s.” He brought his left elbow up on top of the counter,
            propped his chin in his hand and sighed. As he drummed the fingers of his
            right  hand on the countertop, he glanced absent-mindedly up at the wall
            behind the  younger man and only then did he realize what was missing. “Oi!
            You haven’t put  it up yet!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Closing his eyes, Fred shook his head. “Sirius… the odds are-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “No. Don’t start that again. Just let’s see it, yeh?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred sighed, handed Sirius a fresh drink, and swished his  wand at the wall
            behind them to reveal an enormous, ornate board. <em>The Board</em> to be
            precise. A sentient object beyond the limits of their understanding but
            nonetheless enthralling to all who looked upon it. There were countless
            names  scattered across its surface, each with their own corresponding
            dates, times,  and places poised for an endless array of possibilities. Some
            of these names  were intertwined with others at various spots, some
            meandered on their own,  some regrettably disappeared after only a short
            time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Changes, either subtle or grand, would appear at any given  moment, and the
            names would realign themselves with the freshly constructed  dates, times,
            and places accordingly. Thus, the story would continue this new  path until
            another divergence appeared, and so on, once again continuing until  its
            end. Thankfully, for most, the <em>end</em> was the far-right edge of The
            Board. They all vanished eventually though, only to be replaced by new names
            with new dates and times and places. It was mesmerizing to witness such a
            plethora of consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was quite probably the most interesting thing about the  pub and caused
            a great deal of excitement amongst the customers, many of whom  frequented
            the place solely for the purpose of placing a good bet along the  timeline.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred didn’t discover The Board until after he acquired the  pub. He was
            setting up the snooker table when he glanced up at the wall and  there it
            was. Mysterious and alluring, he couldn’t help but take a closer look.  Upon
            further investigation, he deduced that it was a veritable timetable for  The
            Living. Perhaps a little bizarre and even a bit macabre, The Board was
            highly intricate in its detail of people’s lives and as far as Fred knew,
            the  only one of its kind.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were big events such as births, deaths, weddings, and  funerals, but
            there were perfectly mundane things as well, like getting the  post or tying
            trainers. Some of the more amusing ones were of young children  and their
            <em>firsts</em>. First day without a nappy, first swear word, first sausage
            roll, first wand down the loo. All of it was captivating to those in the
            Beyond, who, starved for entertainment as they sometimes were, found they
            could  exist vicariously through such deeds.
        </p>
        <p>
            And the amount of it was staggering. It seemed that every  living person,
            whether magical or muggle, was on The Board if you knew how to  look for
            them. Usually, the patrons were only concerned with those whom they
            personally knew at some point in their own lives, attempting to hold on to
            that  connection for just a little bit longer. Occasionally though, it was
            quite  pleasant to observe the behavior of random strangers like
            <em>
                Bertram. F. Smyth:  27/3/02, 6.27 a.m., Cornwall; argues with milkman/
                shat on by bird
            </em>
            .
        </p>
        <p>
            With every single moment of every single living person laid  bare before
            them, it was difficult not to be swept up into the madness of the  pool.
            Bets were placed both vaguely and acutely, with a payout much greater for
            those bold enough to choose the latter.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, Destiny was fickle, and most things never came to  pass, so to bet
            with such precision was risky. It was daring. It was, in a  sense…
            dangerous. And no one loved a bit of danger more than Sirius Black. He’d
            lost more galleons than any other customer.
        </p>
        <p>
            But he was, as James had said, obsessed with a very specific
            <em>
                possibility
            </em>
            . One that was referenced many times throughout The Board,  enticing Sirius
            to no end. He was incredibly stubborn on the best of days, but  Sirius was
            downright incessant with this event and would not be swayed against  his
            convictions.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, time and time again, Sirius prophesied, and time and  time again he was
            disappointed. Confident in his <em>feelings</em> and  exceedingly desperate
            for as much happiness as the world could manage,  especially when it came to
            Harry, he grew more impatient by the day when they  did not come to
            fruition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred waited good-naturedly while Sirius studied The Board.  When he finally
            spotted what he was looking for, a triumphant grin spread  across his face.
            That certain name was intertwined with Harry’s again in two  places, the
            odds much higher than last time. Yes, it just might well happen  today. He
            hoped it would. It was exhausting waiting for his godson to get what  he
            deserved.
        </p>
        <p>
            “What’ll it be then?” Fred asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Put me down for twenty-” but before Sirius could finish,  Lily reached
            across James to lay her hand over his.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I really would hate to see you lose again, love. You always  get so
            frustrated with yourself afterward.” The bright-eyed witch said.
        </p>
        <p>
            “But Lil, you know as well as I do that it’s been set since  the dawn of
            time!” Sirius was beginning to build up steam. “I mean, look at the  damned
            thing! Their names are written all over it!”
        </p>
        <p>
            She loved the man, but he was too passionate for his own  good sometimes.
            Reminding herself that Sirius was a dear friend who only wanted  what was
            best for her son, Lily made another attempt to douse the fire that
            threatened them all. “James and I have been watching him closely, and I can tell
            you  that he is quite content at the moment, not to mention-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Just look at it! Look. At. It.” Sirius waggled his finger  at The Board,
            his hair flying about with each iteration. Deep breath, he told  himself,
            deep breath. He raked his fingers though his disheveled locks,  attempting
            to calm his ire, but the flared nostrils rather defeated the purpose  and if
            anything, only made him look more deranged.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why couldn’t Lily see how right he was? All the signs were  there! Didn’t
            she want her only child to be blissfully happy for the rest of  his life?
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius redoubled his efforts. “It’s not like I have anything  against the
            girl, you know! She’s a firebrand, and a Gryffindor to boot! Anyone  would
            be lucky to have Ginny be a part of their life, but Lil, you can’t argue
            with these statistics!” he jabbed his finger at The Board once more. “They
            don’t even have a tenth of the timeline possibilities as Harry and Dr-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I understand, love. I really do. But can’t you see just how  fragile things
            still are for him? Harry hasn’t even begun to process most of  what’s
            happened to him these last twelve years.” Lily waited while Sirius  brought
            his breathing back under control, then continued gently. “These things  take
            time.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “But-”
        </p>
        <p>
            Lily sighed. “I can’t tell you what to do with your money.”  Sirius just
            gave her that haughty, pointed look that clearly said
            <em>
                that’s  right, you can’t
            </em>
            . It always managed to get under her skin even after all  this time. “Just
            give it a couple more years.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Years! Wha-”
        </p>
        <p>
            However, before Sirius could protest further, a tall man  with hazel eyes
            and shaggy, short brown hair walked into the pub. He was  dressed smartly in
            a pair of grey linen trousers and a woolen jumper the colour  of Lapis, both
            of which looked exceedingly comfortable on him. If you had known  Remus
            Lupin in life, you would not believe this to be the same man.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gone were the scars, as well as the affliction that had once  marred him,
            only to be replaced by a sense of peace he had not known since the  age of
            four. It was something that he could not regret, no matter how tragic  and
            untimely his death had been.
        </p>
        <p>
            As he took a step further inside the pub, a brightly coloured woman  with bubblegum
            pink hair came tumbling in after him. Her limbs flailed about  for purchase,
            and he caught her gracefully before softly chuckling. He turned  towards the
            bar again, his wife tucked under his arm, and together they came  upon the
            lit man. “Oh, come now, Sirius. You’ve not been placing bets again,  have
            you?” Remus glanced at Lily, who closed her eyes and nodded.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I’ve told him to wait, but you know how he is.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, Remus knew exactly how Sirius was. His best friend, and  lover of nearly
            three decades- including Azkaban and the separation after  his death-
            was a handful to say the least.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>The Incident</em> at the Shrieking Shack in their fifth  year was proof
            of that. The wound that Sirius had left in his heart from that  was deeper
            than any which might have been caused by his monthly  transformations, and
            at one point Remus thought it would never heal. But it  did. Somehow, he
            found the courage to forgive Sirius, the Animagus that loved  him, and from
            this absolution an even greater bond was forged between  them.  And at the
            end of the day, Remus  never really could say no to the man.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were times when he thought he’d gone mental, falling  for Sirius Black
            of all people, but how could you not do? He was dashing and  charming of
            course, utterly beguiling to most people, but there was more to it  than
            that for Remus, and <em>not</em> why he fell in love with him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius was a truly genuine person who stood by his word and  cared for
            others wholeheartedly. He was brave and loyal and kind. He was funny  and
            playful too, and a hell of a lot smarter than most people gave him credit
            for. But Sirius was rash and volatile as well, and his inability to control
            himself left some people questioning his sanity, adhering to the rumors of
            madness which had plagued The Nobel and Most Ancient House of Black for
            countless generations. But Remus loved him still.
        </p>
        <p>
            And even though he wore his emotions on his sleeve, it took  a special kind
            of person to know the real Sirius Black. That was James and  Remus and
            Peter, and in time, Lily. The four friends affectionately referred to  it as
            <em>managing</em> him, something that irritated the man fiercely, and was
            only tolerated out of devotion to their long-standing friendships. Once they
            started dating, however, the task of <em>managing</em> fell mainly to Remus,
            and  Sirius found it rather difficult to complain much after that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remus gave a reassuring squeeze to his mate’s shoulder,  which Sirius
            welcomed fondly. “I know that it’s hard for you to be patient,  Pads, but
            you must realize that Harry still has quite a long life in front  of him.”
        </p>
        <p>
            If Remus was trying to placate him, there was little point  in continuing
            his argument for the time being. Sirius shrugged and sighed in  defeat.
            “Yeah. Well…”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Little James was only just born last week. Do you really  think Harry will
            allow anything to come between him and his son?” When no  answer was forth
            coming, Remus gave another reassuring squeeze to his lover’s  shoulder
            before continuing with his wife to the vacant stools beyond Albus.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Wotcher, Fred! Busy morning?” The bubbly young witch asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            “With this lot, what else?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Tonks stole a glance at her cousin and chuckled at his  huffed indifference.
            Her eyes, that same piercing silver as his own, shimmered  as she continued
            her observation. She and Sirius were very much alike indeed,  right down to
            their notorious Black tempers, although she had the good grace  not to erupt
            at the slightest provocation the way he did. That was her father’s
            influence, always passive, always cheerful, always up for a couple of jars
            and  a chat whenever she needed him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tonks mused over her father’s gentle and comforting nature.  Remus was often
            like that, too. There were still moments when he would pull  away from her,
            but she couldn’t blame him for it. Being a werewolf for more  than thirty
            years had perpetuated his anxiety, and even though he was no longer
            afflicted by it, well, old habits die hard.
        </p>
        <p>
            She gave Remus his space, she understood there were things  he just couldn’t
            share with her.  Those  things, those moments, the ones that made the hairs
            stand up on the back of her  neck, the ones that told the story of
            unbridled, animalistic fierceness, were  reserved for Sirius.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes, Tonks felt she should be jealous of this dynamic,  but for some
            reason she never did. The fact that Remus could confide something  so
            intimate with anyone else warmed her heart and she was especially grateful
            that it was someone as wonderful as Sirius.
        </p>
        <p>
            As her eyes lit on the bar top once more, she took in the  remnants of the
            yellow, fizzing cocktail in Albus’ glass. “Oh, that looks  lovely. What is
            it?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Fred’s latest triumph. Although, I’ve had rather a tough  time convincing
            Sirius otherwise.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I’m sure it’s lovely.” Sirius intoned with a grimace, then  mumbled, “ <em>
            If you like</em> <em>drinking candy floss</em>.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I’ll have one of those, please.” Tonks requested, giggling  at her cousin’s
            obvious disdain.
        </p>
        <p>
            “In a jiffy.” Fred gracefully assembled the glass with  skillful hands,
            taking note of the excited expression on the young witch’s  face. “And never
            you mind ol’ Sirius there, this just isn’t the right kind of  sweet for
            him.” He added, winking at Remus who was forced to stare at the countertop
            to hide his grin. James snorted into his ale.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Just mix your drinks, boy.” Sirius growled playfully before  turning a sly
            eye on his lover.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remus said nothing but continued to grin while gently  shaking his head at
            the countertop and trying not to blush.  Fred shared a mischievous look with
            Tonks as  he passed her the cocktail.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Ta.” she said, the  neon yellow liquid beautifully complementing her bright
            pink hair as she  brought the glass to her lips and took a tentative sip.
            “Oh, this <em>is</em> lovely!” She took another sip. “Ooh, it’s
            <em>
                really
            </em>
            fizzy!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred inclined his head. “Glad you approve. Remus, what’ll it  be, mate?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I’m up for anything.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I have a wonderful London Dry with notes of roasted cacao  nib and orange
            peel. It’s smashing with tonic.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Alright.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred waited patiently for Remus’ approval before turning his  attention to
            Albus. “Another, then?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes. Thank you, Fred.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The young barkeep fixed another fizzing drink for the aged  headmaster, then
            turned towards Lily and James. They were having a quiet  conversation, about
            Sirius no doubt, judging by the glances and grins they were  shooting in his
            direction. “Anything for you lot?” They dismissed his inquiry  politely.
            “And you, Sirius?” he asked, knowing the answer would be in the
            affirmative. When everyone was taken care of, Fred returned to his early
            task  of polishing mugs and preparing nibbles as the conversations around
            him  returned to Little James.
        </p>
        <p>
            “And what an adorable baby he is, too.” Tonks added. “He  looks a great deal
            like Harry already, don’t you think?” She glanced at Lily  and James, who
            smiled warmly and nodded back at her.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Yes, he takes after the Potters, even has your hazel eyes,  dear.” Lily
            said fondly.
        </p>
        <p>
            James chuckled. “And he’ll be a Marauder as well.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Lily’s eyes went wide, her brows hidden beneath her fringe. “He  will not!”
            she exclaimed, only half serious, a little smile playing at the  corner of
            her mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Ah, but it’s on The Board, love.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “That’s right!” Sirius chimed in. “It’s on The Board! It is  writ, Lil, like
            I said before with-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh, mate. Please, can we not have this worn-out argument  filling up our
            heads tonight?” James implored, desperately wanting to enjoy his  pint and
            regretting that he’d ever mentioned the bloody timeline.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius rolled his eyes and mumbled, “You used to be on my  side before you
            got together with <em>her</em>.” He jerked his head towards the  vixen. He
            finished the rest of his tumbler in one gulp and passed the empty  glass
            towards Fred, who hesitantly began preparing another before sending it  back
            to him. “Ever since that day, it’s been ‘<em>Lily’s right, you know’</em>.
            Tragic, that is. I mean, you don’t see me being all cowed by Remus, do you?”
            He  glanced at his lover down the bar who was giving him <em>that</em> look
            again.  Perhaps he shouldn’t have said that last bit.
        </p>
        <p>
            James snorted. “You were saying, Pads?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh, never mind.” Sirius said, desperate to change the  subject before he
            got himself into even more hot water. “What about this  Marauding business,
            eh? I think Little James could give us a run for our money.”  He sipped his
            whiskey, contemplating all the  ways in which the boy could wreak havoc upon
            the innocents. “Do you think Minnie  will still be there by the time he’s
            off to school?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Don’t know. I hope Filch is, though.” James pealed with  laughter, but it
            was short lived as he took in the bright gaze of his former  headmaster.
            “Um, well… I mean… anyway. What’s a little fun now and then, eh?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Lily looked off to some distant point they could not see and  shook her
            head. “If even half the stories about what the four of you got up to  during
            school are true…”
        </p>
        <p>
            Tonks chuckled. “You never did finish telling us about the  time Remus had
            to walk around all day speaking only in dirty limericks.” She  squealed,
            bussing her husband’s cheek, which was showing a rather fine blush.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I cannot believe you told her that, Prongs.” Remus admonished,  his cheeks
            fully red now.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I was drunk- she tricked me!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius let out a weighty guffaw. “That was hands down one of  our better
            pranks, and definitely one of the best days of fourth year.”  He
            gave Remus such a mischievous look that the man had to turn away for fear of
            catching them all on fire with the heat from his face.
        </p>
        <p>
            “But… you didn’t mean to prank Remus, did you? It was an  accident.” Tonks
            looked a bit anxious.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Of course not!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Then who-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Who do you think, Dora?” Sirius stared back at her; crooked  indignation
            etched into his delicate features.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lily gave Sirius a hard look. “Anyway, there are still a  couple of little
            ones to come along yet if things go as planned. And as they  are my
            descendants as well, there’s a good chance they’ll all turn out to be  model
            students.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Ha!” Sirius couldn’t hold back. “That’s only because you  never got caught,
            Evans!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred finished handing Tonks her second Sherbet Lemon and  sidled back over
            to hear the gossip. “Oh, really? Do tell, Sirius.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Lily sporting a sheepish expression was not something you  saw every day.
            “There’s nothing to tell, Fred. I was a goody-goody, plain and  simple.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh, really? Well, I know for a fact that during sixth year,  you were the
            one responsible for raiding Sprout’s private greenhou-” James  clamped his
            hand over his soon-to-be ex-mate’s mouth, preventing him from any  further
            incrimination.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eyes wide, Lily slowly enveloped James’ hand and removed it  from Sirius’
            mouth. “What were you going to say, love?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius looked at James. James looked at Sirius. “Nothing,  Lil. It’s
            nothing. I don’t even remember what we were talking about…” James  relaxed,
            sneaking a glance at his wife, and hoping she wouldn’t hex him.
        </p>
        <p>
            “That’s right. As I said there is nothing to tell.”
        </p>
        <p>
            This was the first time that Remus had heard of James being  privy to
            <em>
                that
            </em>
            little secret. He’d known about it of course, but only  because he’d
            secretly caught her in the act, and not for the last time. But for  Lily to
            blab about one of her misdeeds to James, well, she was just asking for
            trouble. “I’m beginning to think that Prongs should never be allowed to
            drink again  if he’s going to keep spilling all our secrets.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Nonsense, Moony! Everyone needs a good tipple now and then.”  Sirius
            gestured with his fourth empty glass, half-melted ice clinking about. He fumbled and nearly dropped it  on
            the counter.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Steady on, Pads.” Remus knew it would be one of <em>those</em> nights if
            Sirius kept up such a pace. “Fred? A glass of water for the man,  please.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Ahh. ‘m fine Moony.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “You’ve only been here an hour and you’re already well on  your way to
            blotto.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “It’s just to take the edge off! Something’s going to happen  today, Remus,
            and-”
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred knew it was best to intercede, however he couldn’t help  but enjoy the
            show. Sirius was picking up steam once again and with any luck,  he’d do
            something incredibly foolish before the night was out. Unfortunately  for
            him, Lily decided to derail any such possibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I thought we were talking about Little James?” Lily said, her  firm tone
            leading them back into comfortable conversation about her grandson.  As they
            talked, she sipped her ale and looked up at The Board. There were so  many
            things listed there, things she wished she could have been a part of or be
            a part of in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fate had other plans for her though, for all of them. As  hard as she tried
            not to think about the what-if’s and should-have-been’s, Lily  couldn’t help
            but feel a deep longing to be there for the family that never had  the
            chance to know her. James felt the same way, even if he never said it. It
            lingered in the little twitches of his smile or within the laughter of his
            eyes, in the way he said Harry’s name. She knew the others felt similarly
            about  their own lives. As if to prove her thoughts correct, she caught
            Tonks staring  at her with a knowing look.
        </p>
        <p>
            “You miss him.” It was not a question. Tonks had lost that  same opportunity
            and although death made grief and sadness minimal, she still  understood
            what it meant to be a bereft mother. She was silent for a time  before
            adding, “I would’ve loved to have a big family someday, lots of hugs,
            excited faces come Christmas morning, that sort of thing.” She shrugged,
            looking into her half-empty glass.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh, love.” Remus took his wife’s free hand and intertwined  their fingers.
            “We have Teddy, though, and a more amazing child could not be  asked for,
            right?” He tilted her chin up and looked into her eyes, they  mirrored his
            own love and pride for their beautiful son.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I still can’t believe he’s five years old, Remus.” Tonks  allowed herself
            to be pulled into her husband’s arms, a hug full of silent  reassurance.
            “Time flies…”
        </p>
        <p>
            “That it does, love.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Have you seen him much today, then?” Lily asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Most of the morning, then we peeked in on him again just  before heading
            over here. Teddy and mum went to visit Little James…”, Tonks  sipped her
            drink again, a bright smile meeting her eyes. “and he held him! It  was so…”
            She took a moment to collect herself, blinking back the tears that
            threatened to fall.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I could tell he was nervous about doing it, but Harry was  so encouraging,
            so patient, and then Little James looked up at him, and Teddy’s smile was  so big...” A
            tear did escape this time, but Remus quickly wiped it away. Tonks  let out a
            watery chuckle. “Harry was nearly in a state, too.” She briefly  reminisced
            on all the wonderful things that Harry had done for her son in her  absence.
            Block towers, story time, bubble baths, colic, even a disastrous  attempt at
            cooking which her mother quickly commandeered to save the kitchen. “He
            really is doing the most amazing job as godfather.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Of course, he is!” Sirius proclaimed with reverence. “Harry’s  the best
            godfather in the whole world! Would you expect anything less?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Just as you were.” James added. A small smile curled his  lip as he put his
            arm around Sirius once more. His best friend’s eyes were  twinged with
            regret. It was time to change the subject. Reluctantly, and with  only a
            modicum of hope that this would not antagonize the man, he brought their
            conversation back to Sirius’ early argument. “So, you really think it will
            happen today?” James took another sip of his red ale.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Y-you know it will.” Sirius’ voice wavered just a bit,  feeling less sure
            of his convictions in that moment. It didn’t help that James  was giving him
            that familiar, quizzically pitying look. He sighed,  contemplating his next
            words carefully. “Ok, maybe it won’t be <em>today</em>,  but soon. Very
            soon, in fact.” He straightened his shoulders and stuck his chin  in the
            air, and just like that his confidence was restored. “As my dear cousin
            said, time flies.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Wand at the ready, Fred pointed it at the Scorecard posted  just below The
            Board. “Care to revise your bet then, Sirius?” The dark-haired  man just
            shrugged his shoulders while sighing deeply, staring past him lost in
            thought. This could take a while. Fred lowered his wand, shaking his head.
            “Let  me know if you change your mind, mate.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius looked closely at The Board. There were several other  significant
            days in the next six months that looked promising, with one date in
            particular containing two events simultaneously. The
            <em>
                meeting at Ministry of  Magic,
            </em>
            was followed closely by <em>lunch at Leaky Cauldron.</em> Yes, that  could
            really be something. Perhaps they would discuss more than business,  perhaps
            they would finally notice all those little things they had previously
            missed that would lead them to their blossoming romance.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was highly plausible that it would occur on that day, but  Sirius had no
            way of knowing for sure. The Board never explained the cause for  the
            interactions, just the results. Oh, how he wished he could see where it all
            began, but no matter how hard he looked for it, the information was never
            there. Sometimes he wondered if this was done on purpose. The blasted Board
            must surely hate him to be so spiteful.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was so frustrating not knowing what would trigger them  into action.
            Would the old animosity still be present? Would they attempt to  hex each
            other as they worked out their differences? Or would it quite possibly  be
            something far sweeter? Would it be a gentle look or kind word, would they
            have some sort of embrace that set the whole thing into motion?
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius scanned ahead through the next few years. There were  so many events
            listed for the two of them, with more and more occurring the  further on the
            years spanned. It was impossible not to come to this conclusion,  right?
            They <em>would</em> end up together, they just <em>had</em> to, and soon
            everyone would see just how right he was. He could feel the magic tingling
            all  around him, something was there, something was going to happen. It was
            this  final thought which spurred Sirius into action. “Alright, Fred. The
            third of  June, at-”
        </p>
        <p>
            The door opened once again, and the pub’s occupants fell  into a quick and
            deliberate silence. Sirius’ good mood was at an end, for the  man who
            exacted such a response from his friends had crossed the threshold and  shut
            the door with such finality, one could not mistake his intensions. With
            near-silent foot fall and barely a whisper of billowing, black robes, the
            tall,  once sallow-skinned man made his way across the room towards the only
            vacant  stool, right… next… to him. Sirius stiffened, his entire body taut
            as a bow  string, as Snape sat down with nary a word to anyone and greeted
            Fred with a  curt nod.
        </p>
        <p>
            And just like any other day, Fred approached with an easy  step and an
            encouraging smile. “Afternoon, Severus.” His jovial tone breached  the
            quiet, rousing his patrons from their brief arrestation, and soon they were
            relaxing into their comfortable chatter once more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred took the opportunity to push on. He placed a freshly  polished
            Glencairn, followed closely by his finest Ogden’s, before the man he  had
            once tried so desperately to prank at every opportunity. “The usual?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Thank you." Replied the potions master stiltedly. He  knew his greeting was
            less than cordial, but Severus found it rather difficult  to be anything
            more familiar with his former student when the most insufferable  presence
            in the entire universe was sat next to him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius felt the tendrils of Snape’s annoyance reaching out  towards him. A
            recurrent, seething mass of hostility simmering just below the  surface of
            his skin, readying itself to break forth in profuse waves at the  slightest
            provocation. The feeling was utterly mutual. “Leave the bottle, eh  Fred?”
            He pleaded, fastening his hand around its neck.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remus cleared his throat.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Not sure that’s such a good idea, mate. In fact, I think it  best not to.”
            Fred pried the bottle from Sirius’ lamprey-like grip and shuffled  off with
            it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius growled. “At least give me another drink!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred sighed and glanced at Remus, who gave him a reluctant  nod. Another
            whiskey was passed across the countertop to the waiting hands of the
            irritable pureblood.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus inwardly smirked, wondering how long it would take  the man to reach
            the bottom of the bottle if given the chance. The mongrel in  question
            shifted in his seat, trying, and failing miserably to conceal his ire,  a
            good sign indeed. Yes, he was in for a wonderful evening of Black-baiting if
            all went well. But that could wait. For now, Severus would enjoy his whiskey
            in  the relative calm of the only pub this side of existence. At least,
            until the  others decided to draw him into their fatuous banter. They were
            already  attempting to catch his eye.
        </p>
        <p>
            Albus, his mirth ever the same, was the first to venture  forth with a
            cloying platitude. “Good afternoon, Severus. I hope you’ve had a  pleasant
            morning?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes, thank you.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “And have you seen anything interesting of late?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “No.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh. I did rather hope you might be able to tell me how Ms  Soto is getting
            along.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I am no longer in the habit of spying on the living, Albus,  as you well
            know. And furthermore, if I did, it would not be the newest Potions  Master
            or her charge of dunderheaded students.” Severus sipped his whiskey with
            great enthusiasm, hoping the old man would take the hint. Albus naturally
            feigned ignorance.
        </p>
        <p>
            “They are a lot more insightful than you give them credit  for, Severus.
            Why, just the other day Augustina was reprimanding a group of  third year
            students for attempting to make a nefarious looking sticking  solution in
            the back of her classroom. She stopped them just before their  cauldron
            melted through onto young Mr Weatherford’s chair.” Albus chuckled. “She’s
            quite sharp, you know. Brazil must truly regret losing her to Hogwarts.” His
            expression became pensive then, before adding, “Too good to be true, I
            suppose.  She’s destined for great things in her future- and Horace is sure
            to return  once more…” Albus mused, then shook his head. “That man is
            becoming quite  finicky in his old age, you know. If he could only decide
            whether or not to retire  permanently, it would save everyone a lot of
            trouble… The Board of Governors  will never give him the pay rise he
            desires, but he’ll settle in the end, I’m  sure.” The twinkle in his eye
            became, if possible, brighter as he surmised, “Well,  Augustina shall be
            back in twenty years’ time most likely, then I think we’ll  really have
            something to behold. Perhaps, she’ll even surpass your legacy, my  boy.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus clenched his jaw. Did the man never tire of that  infernal place?!
            Why on earth did Albus feel the need to constantly remind him  of something
            he did not miss <em>in the slightest</em>? “If you were already  abreast of
            the latest gossip, why did you bother to ask me?” He snipped.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh, no reason in particular. It was merely an attempt at  polite
            conversation.”
        </p>
        <p>
            If Severus were less of a gentleman, he would tell the  miserable old goat
            to sod off and let him drink in peace. Instead, he  unclenched his jaw and
            continued to sip his whiskey, the alcohol soothing his  vexation into a more
            manageable state while he contemplated how best to rattle  the mutt.
        </p>
        <p>
            Several long minutes or perhaps hours passed for Sirius  where all he could
            focus on was the repetitive sipping and swallowing of  whiskey coming from
            the man sat next to him. The bloody Git was so unnerving!  How long was he
            going to nurse that drink? What was he waiting for?
            <em>
                Just say  it! Get on with it, and just bloody say it!
            </em>
            Any minute now. Any minute, and  that stupid mouth would open and say those
            stupid things about-
        </p>
        <p>
            “Why do you keep insisting on something that will <em>never  happen</em>,
            Black?” Severus’ voice was a piercing blade wrapped in velvet. Silken,
            subtle, dangerous.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius absolutely refused to debate anything with the Snake  today. He would
            not rise to it. He wouldn’t. “Oh, bugger off, Snape!” <em>Damn.</em> He
            quickly forced his breathing back to normal and glanced menacingly over at
            the  man. The Git’s not-so-greasy-these-days hair was obscuring his features
            just  enough that Sirius couldn’t see the satisfied curl of Snape’s lip.
            “You always  think you know everything.” He muttered.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus sneered at him; his iconic eyebrow raised to the  ceiling. “How can
            you fail to see that such a relationship would <em>never</em> work, even if
            there were a remote possibility that it could ever occur in the  first
            place?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius slammed his fist down on the countertop. “Love  conquers all!” he
            growled, staring directly into that ominous hook-nosed face.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Such optimism in the face of adversity.” Severus mocked, a look of
            sheer disgust crossing his face. “Your cloying romanticisms are quite
            revolting. Surely you must realize by now that it makes existence for the
            rest  of us utterly unbearable?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I don’t hear anyone else complaining.” <em>At the moment.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            “Then allow me to put it another way. If you do not refrain  from uttering
            any more of your trite babble in my presence, I will be forced to  cause
            considerable damage to your person.” Severus placed a hand up his sleeve,
            gripping his wand.
        </p>
        <p>
            “No one’s forcing you to be here!” Sirius snarled.
        </p>
        <p>
            “And neither are they, you!” Severus gnashed his teeth, his  voice low and
            threatening.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suddenly Fred stood before them, a warm smile on his face  and Ogden’s in
            his hand. “Gentlemen, gentlemen. Please, let’s not bicker. Come  on now
            Severus, another? On the house? You too, Sirius?” The men acquiesced and  he
            quickly poured their whiskey. Fred shook his head. It was only half one and
            they were already at each other’s throats. He needed to find them a good
            distraction.
        </p>
        <p>
            The universe must have been feeling generous, for just then  the door opened
            and a strapping lad with dark hair and bright grey eyes headed  straight for
            the bar next to Severus. “Hallo, all.” He said kindly before  flashing a
            gentle smile at them. “The usual Freddie, please.” He turned his  attention
            to the dark man beside him. “Professor, it’s nice to see you again.  How’ve
            you been keeping?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus inhaled sharply. “Mr. Diggory, need I remind you  once more that I
            am no longer your professor, nor have I been for quite some  time.” The
            gentle Hufflepuff looked at him so innocently that Severus felt like
            vomiting.
        </p>
        <p>
            He blamed Pomona entirely for this. Her soothing and  coddling and
            near-constant encouragement was the reason they all turned out to  be so…
            sweet. So much so, that Severus found himself unable to do anything more
            than lightly threaten the boy these days. “Do not forget it again or you
            shall  be on the receiving end of a stinging jinx so severe you would wish
            for  Spattergroit in its place.” It sorely lacked the bite with which he
            once  terrified the student body. Yes, entirely Pomona’s fault.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I do apologize sir; it won’t happen again.” Cedric looked  into Fred’s eyes
            and grinned.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred couldn’t help but grin right back at him. “Are you  staying, then?” He
            asked hopefully, passing a half pint of cider over the countertop.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Nah, I’ve got to head over to Col and Lav’s, they still  need my help with
            their anniversary party.” Cedric sipped his cider. “Oh, it  will probably
            end up over here at some point, so fair warning.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius bolted upright on his stool. “Oh goodie! We could do  with a bit of
            excitement.” he quipped, his eyes traveling around the soft edges  of the
            room. It really was an excellent pub, although it felt a bit listless at
            times even with the Git getting under his skin. Yes, a party, full of
            laughter  and cheer. That was just the ticket. He mused over the possibility
            of making it  into a regular occurrence, perhaps Fred would be up for it?
            “You know, we  really should have more youngsters about the place.”
        </p>
        <p>
            A sharp intake of breath and Lily was full on shouting at  him. “Sirius
            Black, bite your tongue!”
        </p>
        <p>
            He nearly toppled off his seat with the force of her  blustering. “What?!”
            he demanded; shock and confusion marring his features.  What in all the
            great cosmos had he done wrong this time? All he said was… then  his eyes
            widened as realization set in. “Merlin’s sake, woman! Are you daft?!”  Did
            she honestly think he wanted people dropping dead just to pop in for a
            piss-up? Never in a million years… “What I meant was, if those kids hanging
            around out <em>there,”</em> he gestured vaguely towards the door, “would
            actually  drop in from time to time, it might be a bit more fun around
            here.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “And a good means for you to go marauding about more often.”  Remus grinned.
        </p>
        <p>
            “The thought never even occurred to me.” Sirius feigned, the  corner of his
            mouth twisting wickedly.
        </p>
        <p>
            James chuckled and finished his pint. “Can’t keep a good man  down, eh
            Padfoot?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius just continued to smile. He had to keep up  appearances after all,
            had to let them still believe he was the undisputed  master of pranks and
            all that rot. He wondered what they would think if he told  them that
            mischief-making no longer held the same appeal for him?
        </p>
        <p>
            What would they say if he told them that all he really wanted  was a few
            nice parties with the people he cared for? All of them milling about  the
            way they should have done if Death hadn’t seen fit to take them so early.
            Laughter, some singing and dancing, maybe even a snog or two in a quiet
            corner.  Like Hogwarts.
        </p>
        <p>
            In those early days of their lives everyone was so carefree.  Just dumb kids
            mucking about at school like everyone else. Then it all changed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius rarely contemplated much about <em>those</em> years. Even  though
            there were truly terrible memories from that time, they just didn’t  matter
            anymore. He was no longer weighed down by the turmoil and the guilt and  the
            desperate longing for the rightness of the world. Sirius had discovered,
            like everyone else here, that negative things couldn’t keep a tether on
            him,  no matter how bad it seemed.
        </p>
        <p>
            That was one of the more amazing aspects of this place,  wherever
            <em>
                this
            </em>
            was. He still felt those emotions, obviously, but they  were more of an
            evocation rather than an actual presence in his mind. Anxiety  over Harry’s
            inadequate love life, occasional jealously towards his cousin for
            monopolizing all of Remus’ time, fear of losing his favourite pair of boots
            or  leather jacket… all just a fleeting moment of strife here in the Beyond.
            Even  those heated moments with Snape at the pub seemed so diffused compared
            to their  childhood pugnacity.
        </p>
        <p>
            In short, Sirius was at peace. He was more content now than  he’d been in a
            very long time, not since before the first war escalated and  they had to
            lose and grieve for so many, before a wedge was driven between  himself and
            Remus. His love… He had no idea just how soon they would be  reunited on
            this plane, and how quickly they would fall back into their old  habits as
            if the war had never happened.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were no words to describe his pure elation at this,  and ever since
            their reunion Sirius had walked around like a besotted sixth  year all over
            again. He was getting soft in his old age, or, well… whatever  happened to
            the dead as time went on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Was there anything wrong with this sentimentality, this <em>squidginess</em>
            ?  No, no there wasn’t. Not for Sirius or anyone else, not anymore. He may
            have  thought differently at the age of twenty, and he would have taken the
            piss out  of Remus or James if they’d ever gone soft themselves, but he
            wasn’t that  person anymore, none of them were. Even James, who barely made
            it to  twenty-one. They had lived their lives and moved on. There should be
            no more  restrictions for any of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, yes. This reestablished carefree existence seemed like  the perfect
            opportunity to celebrate. Afterall, they had nothing <em>but</em> time to
            mill about and chat. And chatting well… there were only so many ways  you
            could retell the story about charming the Slytherin table to fart loudly
            throughout dinner.
        </p>
        <p>
            So why not have a party instead? Every day in fact? And once  Gid and Fab
            and Marls were involved it would really be something. Oh, Cas and  Benj
            could pop in as well! He would propose the idea to Fred, the lad would  love
            it, Sirius just knew he would. Perhaps Colin and Lavender’s party was the
            perfect excuse to bring this up.
        </p>
        <p>
            “It will be good to see those two kids again, it’s been  ages. I’ll even buy
            the first few rounds for the party goers when they get here.”  And that
            reminded Sirius of something else as well. “Oh, how’s Colin’s sister
            getting on these days?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Cedric nodded before swallowing his cider. “Deanna? She’s  fine, more than
            fine from what I’ve been told. Her bloke proposed and they’re  getting a
            little flat in London.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh, brilliant!” Sirius couldn’t help the ear-to-ear grin  spreading across
            his face, he absolutely loved weddings. Everyone else seemed  to feel the
            same, judging by the cheerful chatter around him.
        </p>
        <p>
            “How did her FFS go?” Tonks asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Fantastic. She’s fully recovered and quite happy with the  results. Her
            parents are quite pleased as well.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yeh, well they certainly pushed hard enough for it.” Sirius  added, a
            strange sense of wonder in his voice.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Not really.” Cedric countered. “They just helped Deanna sort  things out a
            bit. As brilliant as potions and spellwork are, they’re mostly temporary.
            The muggle method was the best option in this case.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Did she celebrate, then?" Tonks asked eagerly. "I was really hoping Deanna would  get those flash
            boots from Crispin’s Boutique.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “And that jumper from Gnarly Knitters.” Remus added.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yeah, Colin said she’s gone a bit mad over it, in both  Diagon Alley and
            the muggle shops, but… it is London after all, can’t be  expected to sit on
            your hands.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “London…” Sirius trailed off, thinking of the good old days  once more.
            “Remember our first little flat in Soho, Moony?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Aye.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Those curtains…”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Avocado Green.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “And the kitchen…”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Harvest Gold.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “.......”
        </p>
        <p>
            “.......”
        </p>
        <p>
            “What the bloody hell was wrong with us, Remus?!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Nothing that a quick charm couldn’t fix, Sirius, or have  you forgotten
            about the bathroom?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh, no. Sirius remembered quite well in fact. Late one  night, in a fit of
            desperation, he’d completely renovated the entire flat.  Remus had tried to
            stop him, but..., “That Burnt Orange was the last straw!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Remus chuckled. “You said you loved it at the time.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Well-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Said it was <em>so decidedly muggle</em>.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I know-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Said your mother would hate it <em>so</em> much.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Alright, alright!” Sirius shouted. “So maybe muggles don’t  always have the
            best ideas… but they’re still a million times better than my  dreaded
            family.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Ah-hem.” Tonks was staring at him, her eyebrows raised just  like her
            mother’s.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Not you!” Sirius scoffed, then quickly added, “Or your mum,  or Teddy.
            Alright?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Thank you, cousin.” Tonks replied, then grinned. “So?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “So, what?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Tonks rolled her eyes at him. “So, how did the bathroom  makeover go?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh, um. Fine.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Did you do the rest of the flat as well?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius fidgeted in his seat. “I think I’ll have another  drink, Fred.”
        </p>
        <p>
            It did not go unnoticed by the young barkeep that identical  grins were
            being passed around between Remus, Lily, and James. He approached  Sirius
            with another fresh tumbler. “I’m curious as well, mate.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh, it was so long ago, I can’t really remember. It’s not  important
            anyway.” Sirius was suddenly very interested in his whiskey.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred couldn’t help the laughter that bubbled up and only  just caught it
            before it spilled out of him. “You were drunk, weren’t you?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “No!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Remus chuckled. “Only half-pished, Fred.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Moony!” Sirius’ lips were pursed tightly, his bright eyes  glaring daggers
            at his supposed best-friend and lover.
        </p>
        <p>
            Albus sat forward, glancing between Remus and Sirius. “How  interesting.
            Were you successful in your attempt?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Remus chuckled again. “The charms failed, and we were stuck  with a Seussian
            nightmare that took three days to fix.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh, that horrid Periwinkle and Apricot sofa!” Lily roared.  She was having
            a time of it keeping James upright as he shook with laughter. “I  could
            still see the wretched thing after we changed it back again. Even now if  I
            close my eyes....” She shook her head, the phantom colors dislodging from
            her  sight once more.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh, give over, Evans.” Sirius barked. A disgruntled huff  came from his
            left side.
        </p>
        <p>
            “How typical of you, Black. Always acting before you can think.”  Severus
            took the remaining sip from his glass and sat it down before him.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Nothing wrong with a little rash behavior now and then,  Snape. Keeps you
            on your toes.”
        </p>
        <p>
            It was on the tip of Severus’ tongue to remind Black of his
            <em>
                rashness
            </em>
            in the Department of Mysteries, but something held him back. That same
            something which dulled his acerbic wit with regard to the Diggory boy. He
            couldn’t quite place the feeling, foreign and forgotten to him as it was,
            like  fragments of a reoccurring dream that had long since abated. Severus
            did not  like it.
        </p>
        <p>
            He had spent so many years belittling the man sat next to  him that any
            instance of cessation these days thoroughly disquieted him. Why did  it take
            so much effort to berate the mutt in this place? Black prattled on
            endlessly about a subject that was less interesting to him than watching
            paint  dry. He could have crushed him with one blow if they were still
            alive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perhaps he was merely too exhausted by the asinine musing of  the fool to be
            vicious? It would make perfect sense. Yes, that must be the  reason. He
            mustered what was left of his vitriol, settling for a mild insult in  its
            stead. “Pathetic.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Ha! You almost sound a bit jealous there, Snape.” Sirius  laughed, sipping
            at his whiskey. “But I suppose that’s to be expected from an  old stick in
            the mud like yourself. You wouldn’t know a good time if it jumped  up and
            bit that great, ugly conk of yours.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The mutt must be slipping if he’d regressed into using such a  petty slur.
            It was subpar at best, and Severus didn’t even feel the need to  respond,
            but he had a reputation to consider so… “Well, if a good time involves
            throwing your life aw-”
        </p>
        <p>
            CRASH!!!
        </p>
        <p>
            “Sorry, sorry everyone.” Fred apologized as he ducked down  behind the bar
            to clear away the large tray of nibbles that he’d dropped. “Didn’t  mean to
            give anyone heart failure, or, um… whatever.” <span style="color: darkorchid;">He  barely caught Severus’
    words in time and sincerely hoped that little stunt was  enough to diffuse
    the tension.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            “Let me help you with that.” Cedric offered, setting his  glass down.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Already taken care of, see? Good as new.” Fred produced a  fresh tray full
            of Ploughman’s. “Want anything?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Cedric shook his head. “Nah. I’d better be off. See you all  later then.” He
            looked around the room before pushing his empty glass across  the bar top,
            brushing his thumb against the back of Fred’s hand as he did so. “Later,
            then?” he said with that Witch Weekly smile of his.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred grinned back, “Later.” Then he leaned over the countertop  and offered
            a delicate, lingering kiss to the man he loved. For a moment they  forgot
            where they were, until their ex-professor huffed his annoyance at them.
            Cedric chuckled and quickly bussed Fred’s cheek before heading out the door.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh, rub it in why don’t you.” Sirius snipped, crossing his  arms over his
            chest, and looking away from Fred.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Sorry, mate.” Fred couldn’t help the slight blush that  crept up his
            cheeks.
        </p>
        <p>
            “It’s just so unfair.” Sirius groaned. “Everyone’s happy but  me. I hate
            being alone all the time.” He pouted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus scoffed. “What do you mean <em>alone</em>? Your <em>boyfriend</em>
            is sitting not six feet away from you?” He snapped.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Not that it’s any of your business, but he’s been rather  busy with his
            <em>wife</em> lately.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oi!” Tonks yelled, affronted on both her and Remus’ behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus continued talking right over her. “Oh, what a pity.  You only see
            him every other day then, how dreadful.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Ha! Shows what you know. It’s been four days since he spent  time with me.
            THAT’S NEALRY AN ENTIRE WEEK!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Remus knew he shouldn’t feel guilty, but he couldn’t help  it. “Now Sirius,
            you know that-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “
            <em>
                Look at me, everyone! I’m forced to share my toys with  someone else!”
            </em>
            Severus’ affectation of the petulant pureblood was most  uncanny, but then
            again, he was subjected to his constant whinging, so... “<em>I, the Great
            Sirius Black, should never have to give  even a modicum of
            happiness to other people!”</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            It was moments like these  which reminded
            Severus vividly of why he detested the man so much. Nothing was  ever good
            enough for him. He always had to be the center of attention and  fawned over
            by the masses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Disgusting. Enough to drive even the sanest of people  utterly mad. Black
            was beyond insufferable. “For someone who believes in having  an open
            relationship, you are rather closed off about it, aren’t you?” Severus
            sneered.
        </p>
        <p>
            This bickering irritated Remus to no end. Why couldn’t they  both just…
            “Now, Severus. That’s a bit harsh, you know.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Damn right, Moony! You see, Snape? Remus agrees with me  that I’ve been
            neglected-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I didn’t say <em>that</em>, Sirius.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “But you <em>have</em> been neglecting me!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Teddy’s had a lot of milestones recently and-”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius couldn’t help but whine. “But you don’t even really  like each other
            all that much! I mean, come on Remus. You know she’d rather be  out with
            Amelia right now, anyway.” He stated matter-of-factly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remus couldn’t refute it; Amelia and Dora were practically  inseparable
            since they had become reacquainted on this side of the ether. She’d  even
            gone so far as to profess her love for the woman in front of everyone one
            night at the pub.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius knew it wasn’t right to take his frustrations out on  his cousin, he
            just couldn’t help it. He was there first!  He looked away from the hurt he
            knew was in  Remus’ eyes and muttered, “I don’t see why you need to spend
            quite so much time  together.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Tonks had to put her foot down. “Sirius. I’m sorry that  you’ve felt
            neglected, but Remus and I needed a little extra time together. We  miss our
            Teddy so much and not being there for him is hard on us. You can  understand
            that, can’t you?” He wouldn’t look at her, choosing to stare at his  glass
            instead, no doubt thinking about Harry. She sighed. “I know how important
            Remus is to you, but he and I need each other as well sometimes.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Thoroughly admonished, Sirius kept his head down as he  prepared his
            apology. “I’m sorry, Dora.” He wanted to say more to her but  couldn’t find
            the words.
        </p>
        <p>
            He looked up into Remus’s Forest colored eyes, those eyes  that let him soar
            above the clouds and kept his feet on the ground at the same  time. “I’m
            sorry, Remus. Sometimes… I just… forget.” He raised his hands, not  knowing
            what else to do. “Sometimes, I can only remember those years we had
            together and how long it took for us to get there in the end.” Sirius never
            thought they would be apart, but the war and Azkaban…
        </p>
        <p>
            When he’d finally made his way back to Hogwarts to save  Harry and have his
            revenge, he vowed never to lose hold of Remus again. Then he  died.
            Fortunately for him, Sirius’ vow was strong enough to bring them back
            together. He knew Remus would have sought him out even if it hadn’t been. He
            continued staring into those beautiful eyes, remembering all that they’d
            shared  in their youth. “I guess I just find myself lost in those moments.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “It’s easy to do.” In that instance Remus could see the  young man he had
            fallen in love with, and the rest of existence dissolved away into  nothing.
            He sighed and chuckled. “You and I always did have trouble with
            communication, didn’t we?” Six long years of pining and misinterpretation
            were  proof positive of that. “I’m sorry, too.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus scoffed loudly at them. “You don’t own him anything,  Lupin.” The
            mutt was such a-
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh, shut up, Snape! You have no idea what it’s like to be  snubbed.” Sirius
            glared at him. How dare the Greaseball interrupt he and Remus’  special
            moment!
        </p>
        <p>
            This was more than Severus could bear. He stared down his  hated rival,
            putting all his malice into it. “Forgive me for not commiserating  with you,
            Black.” he spat. “Perhaps you will recall that I have spent literal
            <em>
                decades
            </em>
            of my life forever being denied my heart. If you could even begin to fathom
            what that is like, perhaps I would be a little more sympathetic to your
            plight.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius grimaced as if a nasty odor had wafted through the  room and rolled
            his eyes dramatically. “Sorry. I forgot.” He mocked.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus reached for his wand. “Why, you insolent-”
        </p>
        <p>
            Lily could see where this was going fast and grabbed Sirius’  arm before he
            had a chance to respond with a hex. “Severus, please.” She  implored.
            “You’ve got to let it go, for everyone’s sake.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Let it go? <em>Let. It. Go</em>?” Severus looked  incredulously into those
            brilliant green eyes he knew so well. How could she  say such a thing to
            him?
        </p>
        <p>
            She knew how he felt about her, how he had stayed true to  her memory and
            kept her brat-of-a-son alive all those miserable years. Severus  sacrificed
            everything, <em>everything</em> for her! The little girl who played  with
            him in the park every day. The person he shared all his secret ambitions
            with before going off to Hogwarts. His only real friend.
        </p>
        <p>
            And Severus loved her still, he always would, nothing could  ever change
            that. It ran deeper than any ocean or higher than any mountain, it  had
            transcended time and space to exist within him here in this realm.
        </p>
        <p>
            As he continued to stare into Lily’s beautiful eyes, Severus  realized it
            was pointless to argue with her. She took the fight out of him with  a
            single glance. She always did. It was a calming force that left him feeling
            safe and loved, as if he truly mattered to someone, even during Hogwarts
            when  the bullying was at its worst.
        </p>
        <p>
            Until <em>that</em> day… not something he cared to remember  while he was
            still alive. In this place, however, the memory was different, the  pain
            was… barely a shade of its former self. If he were honest, Severus would
            say that everything was different here. Even the presence of <em>him</em> on
            her  arm wasn’t agonizing to witness anymore.   Potter looked at him then
            with a slight curve of his lip, and Severus  realized the hatred between
            them truly was diminished. They weren’t friends by  any means, but they were
            amicable for Lily’s sake. He sighed in defeat.
        </p>
        <p>
            She sighed as well. “We both know that what happened was for  the best. You
            and I would always have been better as friends.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Perhaps if you had given me another chance to prove myself  while we were
            still alive, then-”
        </p>
        <p>
            Lily had forgiven him a long time ago for his slight, and  more recently,
            herself, for abandoning him so readily.  She was glad for their
            reacquaintance and  subsequent friendship that had blossomed once more, but
            oh was he stubborn. “You  never would have been truly happy with me,
            Severus, you were merely projecting  your feelings-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I did no such thing! Those feelings for you were entirely  genuine!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Albus inclined his head at this statement. “<em>Were</em>, Severus?” He
            could still recall the anguish in the younger man’s voice as he  uttered the
            word <em>Always</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes, well.” Severus gazed into Lily’s eyes once more and  felt the full
            weight of his proclamation settle in his chest. The truth. It was  no
            trivial matter, discussing his feelings, and to do it in front of everyone
            only made it that much harder, but Lily was so open with him, her eyes
            beseeching.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I do still love you. I always will. However, I may have…  come to terms
            with your… that is to say, I… I recognize the situation differently.”  There,
            he’d said it, and now she knew what he dared not admit to himself. He  had
            let her go. No one said anything for several moments as Severus and Lily
            continued to gaze at each other in silent understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was Sirius’ turn to scoff.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus returned his full attention to the cocksure man next  to him. The
            idiot needed to be brought down a peg or two, for everyone’s sake. “Which
            brings us back to our earlier debate. This incident only further proves my
            point that a Gryffindor and a Slytherin can never be-”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius snorted with contempt. “Oh, please. Just because you  and Lily never
            got together doesn’t mean Harry and-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I think I know my <em>own</em> godson better than you do <em>yours</em>,
            Black.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “How do you figure that?!” Sirius was livid. How dare the  man tell him that
            he didn’t understand Harry!
        </p>
        <p>
            A cruel grin spread itself across Severus’ face. Oh, this  was going to be
            <em>good</em>. The mutt was practically foaming at the mouth  already.
            “Well, let’s see…” he began. “You knew <em>your</em> godson for
            approximately two years of his life, three if you count his infancy.” He
            made a  dramatic show of enumerating with his fingers before the unhinged
            Gryffindor. “However,  with your incarceration, your stint as a fugitive,
            and your overall  non-existent status as a care giver, the accumulative time
            would be closer to  several months.” He closed his fist once more with blunt
            finality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, the mutt’s crystalline eyes were bulging, and a small  tremor had begun
            to overtake his lithe build. He was so close to cracking.  Severus leaned
            against the countertop with delicate nonchalance and crossed his  arms. “I,
            on the other hand, had the pleasure of knowing <em>my</em> godson for
            nearly eighteen years.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “You bloody bastard!” yelled Sirius, his nostrils flaring  and eyes aflame
            with such vehemence that a lesser man than Snape would have  crumbled in an
            instant. As it was, the Great Bat just smirked at him with his
            characteristically raised eyebrow.
        </p>
        <p>
            That was the last straw for Sirius, they would have this out  once and for
            all! He reached for his wand as James stepped close behind. Yes,  his best
            mate had come to his aid, a pillar of strength in his time of need,  his
            comradery a welcome pinnacle with which to stand upon.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, as Sirius reached up his sleeve James pulled his  hand back down
            and held it fast within his own firm grip. “James!” He  struggled; his arms
            forcibly pinned to his sides. “What’s the matter with you?  Didn’t you hear
            what he said?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes, Padfoot.” James was gritting his teeth. It was like  wrestling a giant
            toddler who didn’t want his bath. “I did. Oomph!” An elbow in  his side.
            “You can’t just… ah!” An awkward slap to his ear. “Stop and listen a
            moment, will you? ARGH!!!” He’d have a black eye for sure.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Shit, Prongs! I’m sorry!” Sirius, wand forgotten, had his  hands splayed
            over James’ face trying to assess the damage. “I’m really, really  sorry.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Calm down, mate.” James pleaded as he restrained the  prodding fingers on
            his cheek. “It’s fine, see?” And it was, for Lily had  already cast an
            Episkey and not even a hint of swelling remained. She shook her  head at
            both of them as James gently pushed Sirius back down onto his stool. “Now,
            will you listen to me?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius wanted to apologize again but James was already  staring at him in
            earnest and the words dissolved on his tongue. He sighed. “Yes.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “You know he’s just trying to bait you?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “He wants to get under your skin.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I know.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “So, he’ll use Harry as a means to do that.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “He always does.” Sirius grumbled.
        </p>
        <p>
            “And you fall for it every time.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius just shrugged his shoulders, decidedly not looking  into those
            knowing hazel eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
            James thought carefully before uttering his next words. “So,  why don’t you
            stop? Why let Severus get the better of you?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Because that’s what he does! That’s what I do! It’s always  been like that,
            Prongs!” Sirius was seething now, and the room felt way too hot  around him.
            He hated this! Why did James always rush to intervene instead of  helping
            him hex the Git?
        </p>
        <p>
            “It used to be <em>us</em>, not just me, fighting against <em>that</em>.”
            He waved his hand in the general direction of the Snake without taking his
            eyes  off his best friend. The pillock was probably still grinning at him
            like a  sphinx but Sirius couldn’t be arsed about it.
        </p>
        <p>
            James, the man he called brother and confidant, just stared  at him with
            that familiar pitying, bone-weary look furrowed into his brows, and  it
            nearly broke him. Nearly. The rush that had been there a moment ago began to
            recede and his breathing returned to normal. It was spooky how this place
            took  the bite out of him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Levelheaded once more, but with the dregs of his anger still  intact, Sirius
            asked the question he’d wanted to know the answer to since he  discovered
            James’ disinterest in bullying. “Why, Prongs? Why don’t you fight  back?
            Have you forgotten what a slimy, deceitful, disgusting, piece of  Hippogriff
            shite he is?”
        </p>
        <p>
            That string of insults seemed a bit much, even for Sirius of late,  and Remus could
            see that Severus was itching to draw his wand. How much more  would it take
            for them both to do the other some kind of major injury? Could  they be so
            injured? They were dead after all. It wasn’t the first time Remus  had
            thought this and it probably wouldn’t be the last. “Now, Sirius. I think
            you-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Stay out of this, Remus!” Sirius shouted just a bit more  forcefully than
            he meant to, it wasn’t Moony he was mad at anyhow. Then he saw  Tonks cover
            Remus’ hand with her own in a consoling effort and he decided to  reevaluate
            that thought. “Both of you!” He jabbed his finger at them, hoping  very much
            not to look like a petulant five-year-old.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus peeled with laughter, a rare occurrence indeed. “You  are so
            predictable, Black. Even a hint of affection between them sets you off.”  He
            could tell the mongrel was fighting to control himself once more.
            <em>Good. The fool should be on edge.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            “That saccharine abnormality you call <em>love</em> is no  match for such
            toxic jealousy." Severus taunted, then slowly narrowed his eys and grinned malevolently.
            "Oh, what a devastating insecurity <em>that</em> is, how it
            consumes and destroys you little by little.” He chuckled
            darkly, glaring at the distraught pureblood beside him.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Can’t let it go, can you? Can’t stand the fact that you  don’t have him all
            to yourself anymore.” The idiot glared back at him, the rise  and fall of
            his chest clearly visible as he fought to suppress his mounting  rage.
            <em>
                Just a little further… so close to utter
            </em>
            <em>ruination.</em> “Well,  get used to it, Black! There’s nothing you can
            do about it.” Severus sneered at  the man, a wicked gleam in his eyes. The
            weight of his words was beginning to  exhaust him, but he didn’t care, he
            couldn’t stop now.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Terrible, isn’t it? Trying to adjust.” <em>Go for the  jugular.</em>“Well,
            I’m sure you can find another chew toy to occupy your free  time.” Severus
            allowed the pronounced silence to linger on the air, giving  himself a
            momentary respite. “No?... More’s the pity.” He said mockingly. A  small
            flicker of <em>something</em> in the mutt’s silver orbs caught his
            attention. What was it? Doubt? Despair?
        </p>
        <p>No. It was petulance once again.
            <em>Of  course</em>.</p>
        <p>
            “Or is it,” he began slowly, his tone dangerous once more. “that  no one
            else will do? No one else will ever be good enough for the great Sirius
            Black.” Severus lowered his voice perilously, that sheathed blade coming out
            to  play again. “Admit it then, Black. Admit that you are the selfish,
            cold-hearted  abomination we all know you to be.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Remus had had enough. “That really is uncalled for, Severus.  Sirius is
            not-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I don’t recall asking for your opinion, <em>Lupin</em>.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Regardless, <em>Severus</em>,” Remus growled. “Sirius is my  best friend
            and partner whom I love with all my heart, and I cannot allow you  to say
            such things about him.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “And just what will you do to me, hm?” Severus sneered at  Remus, a
            decidedly malicious glint in his eye.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the wolf remained silent, Severus merely raised his  eyebrow. The man
            wouldn’t do it, no. He’d given up the fight, just like Potter.  He smirked,
            delighted with the power he held over the beast. Pity it took until  his
            death to reach such a point, but better late than never he supposed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus would have chuckled at this small victory but for  the penetrative
            stare Lupin kept upon him, his calm demeanor belying his poise,  an animal
            ready for attack. A cold chill crept its way up Severus’ spine,  making the
            little hairs at the nape of his neck stand to attention. Still,  those mossy
            hazel eyes never left his own as the silence stretched on and the  weight of
            the wolf’s gaze became palpable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus kept up his facade, the arch of his brow unwavering  as chiseled
            marble, his posture stiff, but underneath that timeless mask was an
            elevated heat rate and perspiration on his palms. He was forced to look away
            or  risk shuttering right in front of everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            The brute still had such an effect on him after all. He  wouldn’t, he
            <em>
                couldn’t
            </em>
            let anyone else see that. Severus scoffed his  uneasiness into the half
            empty tumbler as he brought it to his lips. He could  sense that Lupin was
            still watching him and forced himself to stare into the  remnants of his
            drink.
        </p>
        <p>
            It had always been that way, even before <em>that</em> night  in the
            Shrieking Shack so many years ago. Severus had never been able to deduce  in
            those days exactly what it was that caused such an emotive sensation to
            crawl its way across his body. A tingling that spread from his middle, out
            through his limbs and beyond his fingers and toes.
        </p>
        <p>It must be the wolf. There  was simply no other explanation for it.</p>
        <p>
            Severus wondered if this was the type of thing that drew  Black to Lupin,
            that raw animalistic power. Or was it something deeper,  unfathomable to all
            but those capable of seeing past the bookish goody-goody  prefect exterior.
            No, that was madness. Black was shallow and vain, incapable  of breeching
            anything beyond the depth of a teaspoon.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, it must have been the novelty of associating with a dark  creature.
            Something dangerous and forbidden, oh yes, that would definitely suit
            Black.  Afterall, how many people could  or would claim to have even a
            passing acquaintance with a werewolf, let alone a  solid friendship? It was
            perfect for banking the fire of Black’s inflammable  ego.
        </p>
        <p>
            And yet… and yet Black had kept that precious secret, never  betraying
            Lupin, never once seeking out what could have been easily gained from  the
            exposure. Unless you counted The Shack incident, but Severus didn’t believe
            for a moment that Black actually had the intelligence to orchestrate what
            transpired that night. Shear dumb luck on the mongrel’s part, that was all.
            That, and Severus’ hunch and curiosity, and stupidity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh, the humiliation he’d suffered at the hands of the  Marauders! And the
            repercussions of those particular actions were… burdensome  to say the
            least. Nightmares, cold sweats, panic attacks that he’d desperately  tried
            to conceal from his fellow students and eventual staff members. At one
            point he felt sure he was becoming addicted to Dreamless Sleep, the only
            thing  that kept him from those bright yellow eyes and huge, sharp fangs.
        </p>
        <p>
            In time though, the overwhelming fear and anxiety lessened,  and Severus
            found the occasional flashback to be little more than a subtle  irritant.
            Until Potter’s sprog graced everyone with his presence in ‘91, that  is. But
            it was still entirely manageable even with such a strong visual  reminder of
            the worst years of his life.
        </p>
        <p>
            It wasn’t until Lupin was employed at the School for  Dunderheads that said
            irritant became a full-blown rash, exacerbated by the  near-constant
            hovering of the flaming-nuisance-of-a-man himself. Lupin seemed  to be
            everywhere that he was <em>all the bloody time</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every free moment between classes or at mealtimes it was,
            <em>
                ‘Hello,  Severus. How are you today?... Good day to you, Severus. Lovely
                weather,  wouldn’t you agree?... Would you care to join me for a cuppa
                in the Staffroom? The Darjeeling is quite good...
                Thank you again, Severus  for brewing the Wolfsbane potion. You have no
                idea how immensely helpful you’ve  been to me…. I know we never got on
                in school, but we’re both adults now and  I’d really like to bury the
                hatchet and try for some sort of friendship with  you.’
            </em>
            Oh, Severus really wanted to bury a hatchet as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            He could have let Lupin’s secret slip out then and saved  himself months of
            aggravation, but no, Albus was always watching him. He should  have done it
            anyway, consequences be damned. Severus had gone soft, or at the  very least
            had taken a turn in that direction. He should have realized it,  should have
            seen it in those moments when he didn’t hex Potter on the spot for  his
            insubordination, but he didn’t.
        </p>
        <p>
            He kept his mouth shut and by early spring he’d felt as if said  rash had
            begun to diminish just a bit. Severus even sat in the staff lounge  once
            with Lupin, both of them grading papers in their respective silence, and
            most certainly <em>not</em> sharing a cuppa from the same tea service. Then
            it  happened again, and again, and again, to the point of them occupying the
            staff  room together once a week. It became… tolerable. It became familiar.
            It became  welcomed after the onslaught of adolescent idiocies he was
            subjected to  constantly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lupin was, he discovered quickly, intelligent enough to  carry a decent
            conversation and had a depth of knowledge that surprised him,  especially
            with regards to defensive magic. Severus began to think that perhaps  if he
            were forced to stay on at Hogwarts forever it might not be quite so
            insufferable  anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then Black showed up to ruin everything just like he always  did, and the
            wretch even managed to force Severus to relive one of the most  terrifying
            moments of his life. If Black had never escaped to the Castle, if  that
            Merlin-forsaken Map had never been in Lupin’s possession, if the Potter
            brat could have <em>for once</em> listened to his betters and left things
            alone…
        </p>
        <p>
            It all came crashing down on Severus once more, and in a  relapse of severe
            trauma he’d outed Lupin to his Slytherin charges. He’d ruined  the man’s
            future chances of employment and effectively alienated him from the  wary
            public forever.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus was right to do it, he knew he was. He told himself  it was
            necessary, that Albus was senile, and the masses had a right to know. He
            was not feeling guilty. He was not ashamed. Lupin was a werewolf! He was
            dangerous! A dark creature that could potentially kill any one of them…
        </p>
        <p>
            A man that wanted nothing more than to enjoy his Darjeeling  in the
            afternoons and read quietly by the fireside.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even now Severus could feel the lingering twist in his gut.  Regret. He’d
            done it. There was no going back. Not that it mattered anymore  since they
            were both dead, but there were moments when he desperately wanted to
            apologize.
        </p>
        <p>
            It surprised him more than anything else. He hated Lupin,  didn’t he? Yes.
            Yes, he despised him almost as much as Black. Or at least  that’s what he
            told himself repeatedly as he stole glances from behind his  curtain of
            hair. He chanced another look now. Lupin was absorbed in a  conversation
            with the Weasley boy about Merlin knew what. That strange feeling  was
            spreading through his torso again. Oh, <em>why</em> wouldn’t it go away?
        </p>
        <p>
            “What the hell are you staring at, Snape?!” Black snarled.  His brow’s
            furrowed accusingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Damn</em>. He’d been caught out by the mutt. “Nothing!”  There, that
            should be a sufficient comeback for Black. The fool was oblivious  to
            everything but himself, he couldn’t know what Severus was thinking, could
            he? “And if anyone is staring, it’s <em>you</em>.” Severus set his jaw
            severely,  throwing his most intimidating glare at the man.
        </p>
        <p>
            Black continued to eye him suspiciously for a moment, his  nostrils flaring
            once more, but then shook himself out of whatever thoughts he  might have
            had and begrudgingly relaxed back into his seat.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh, this infernal place! It made Severus lose his edge. He’d  been a spy for
            nigh on twenty years and in that time had cultivated a mask so  impenetrable
            that even Albus would second guess him occasionally. He never let  anyone in
            completely, not even Lily, but here, wherever this was, he’d let his  guard
            down. Trust Black to find his weak spot. Severus watched him for another
            minute from the corner of his eye. Black was now looking quizzically at
            Lupin. <em>Bizarre  idiot.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius was watching Remus as he gazed intently at Fred. That  gentle smile,
            those focused eyes. It was always so with him. Remus listened to  people,
            <em>really</em> <em>listened</em>, as if they were the only other person in
            the whole world. It was comforting, knowing he cared that much.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even when he didn’t agree with something, Remus was respectful  of other
            people’s convictions, as long as they weren’t of the dubious variety.  If
            you were, however, to wax nefarious, you would regret it immediately. Fierce
            was an understatement for Remus, his wrath, though rarely ever seen, was
            terrible to behold. Such an utter contrast to his quiet nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            Had Snape noticed? Was that his reason for staring as Remus?  Sirius had
            caught him at it once before but shrugged it off as the Git’s usual
            predatory  viciousness. He couldn’t be sure, though.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just now he’d thought there was something… <em>more</em> in  those obsidian
            eyes. Sirius didn’t like it. Whatever that feeling was that he  couldn’t
            quite place had surfaced, clawing its way out through his throat, and
            before he could stop himself, Sirius had yelled the first thing that came to
            mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            He couldn’t focus. His breathing once again had sped up and  his thoughts
            blurred together as he tried to decipher the hidden meaning behind  that
            look. In the interim, Snape had snapped back at him, words muted by his
            current conundrum, and Sirius was forced to return to the present. Oh, how
            he  hated the bastard!
        </p>
        <p>
            He was torn between riling up the Git further or  concentrating on his
            muddled thoughts. In the end, just as always, the negative  ones dissipated
            before he could unleash them. Sirius shook himself out of his  situation and
            looked to Remus instead. That had been too weird. Whatever it was  he
            thought he saw, seemed, in that moment, to have been nothing more than a
            phantom notion. Sirius divested those thoughts once more, reassuring himself
            that there would be time to analyse them later. For now, he had to plan his
            counterattack  against the Greasy Bat.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus needed to regain control, quickly, and the best way  to do it was by
            getting the demented pureblood off on another tangent. Perhaps,  if he were
            careful, he could bring up Black’s miserable losing streak. No, it  would
            only lead to that stupid notion of his that Potter and Dra-
        </p>
        <p>
            “Why do you always look like a kneazle’s sicked up on your  boots, eh?”
            Sirius queried. From the corner of his eye, he could see Remus was  studying
            him now, a question in that silent stare. He leaned his elbows back  against
            the countertop and raised his brow, a self-satisfied quirk to his lip,
            knowing just how much his smugness affected the ugly Git. “Is it just severe
            constipation or…”
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus really did hate the man. “Actually, I was thinking  about your
            disgusting obsession with everyone’s love life, and your pathetic  attempts
            at matchmaking.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “<em>What?</em>” Black’s voice had taken on a hard edge.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Sirius.” Remus warned.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Are you deaf or just deranged? Oh, wait. Don’t bother to  answer that.”
            Severus relished the low growl emanating from Black at the  familiar taunt.
            The idiot tensed his shoulders as his wand hand twitched  momentarily.
        </p>
        <p>
            Black opened his mouth to bark something that was sure to be  truly asinine,
            but Severus cut him off. “You <em>would</em> grasp for purchase  beyond your
            own convoluted relationship, wouldn’t you? Anything to make it more
            bearable. So eager, so desperate. Some might go so far as to call you a
            hopeless romantic, projecting your idiot notions onto the unsuspecting, as
            you  do. I however,” Severus grinned wickedly, “know the truth. That you
            are, in  fact, merely… hopeless. Hopeless, Black. In every sense of the
            word. Pathetic.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Severus.” Remus growled.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Pathetic, am I?!” Sirius spat. “Who’s the one in an actual  relationship,
            then, eh? Who’s got something besides their own hand waiting for  them at
            home? It’s certainly not you!” Sirius yelled triumphantly. His shining  eyes
            and broad grin were verging on psychotic at this point.
        </p>
        <p>
            He eased back against the countertop once more, his languid  body in utter
            contrast with the wickedness set about his face. “Exactly when  was the last
            time you had a shag, Snape?” he finished spitefully. Sirius  crossed his
            arms over his chest and sniggered, not feeling at all like a  twelve-year
            old.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regardless of how accurate the demented man was about a  very, truly,
            <em>
                completely non-existent,
            </em>
            over-acquaintance that Severus  might have had with his left hand, he was
            sure it was merely a means of  distracting him from the bastard’s unease. He
            did not fail to notice the  pettiness in Black’s voice, nor the slight
            tremor coursing through the mutt’s  body; this was definitely a sore spot
            that needed poking.
        </p>
        <p>
            With all the cunning he could muster, and his voice low and  velvety once
            again, Severus went in for the kill. “Waiting for you at home, is  he? You
            mean the man sat over there…” he inclined his head towards the other end  of
            the bar, all the while keeping his eyes trained on Black, “with his
            <em> wife</em>?  His sweet, bubbly, perfect little wife? Oh, yes. That’s the operative
            word,  isn’t it? <em>Wife</em>. A legally bound partner that the Ministry
            recognizes as  his spouse. Something… that you <em>never</em> were. All
            those wasted years  pining for something you could <em>never</em> have.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus paused, allowing his words to take hold of the  mongrel, whose mild
            tremors earlier had redoubled their efforts causing him to  shake with
            suppressed rage. He knew it was really going to happen this time.  That
            Sirius Black would finally shatter, and all the tiny pieces would never  fit
            together again. He just needed to keep it up a little longer, just a little
            further.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus could feel tremors forming over his own body now,  the anticipation
            of seeing this man unravel in front of him was almost too  much. He faltered
            only for a moment and then struck. “The same man who’s been  absent from
            said home for ‘<em>nearly</em> <em>an entire week’</em>? I thought… he
            lived with <em>you</em>? Spent every day sharing cuppas and crosswords and
            cuddles on your favorite sofa?” Severus feigned disbelief.
        </p>
        <p>
            “What about all your cozy little nights together? Where have  they gone?
            Walks in the park? Trips to the seaside?” Severus clutched at his  chest
            with a dramatic gasp. “Oh, that’s right! Lupin spends all that time with
            <em>her</em> now, doesn’t he? Talking about <em>their</em> son, their
            <em>
                perfect, wonderful
            </em>
            son that you could never have. Reminiscing on how happy they were together
            before the end, how they wished it could go on forever and ever-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Damn you, Snape!” Sirius was near hyperventilating again. “I’ll  hex you
            into oblivion!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus chuckled darkly. “It’s a little late for that,  Black! We’re already
            dead. Not much sport there, I’m afraid.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “We’ll see about that!” Sirius raised his wand.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Stop it, both of you!” Remus tried to yell over the din.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Pathetic, juvenile, love-sick fool, who will never have what he so
            desperately craves!” Severus growled.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Stop calling me pathetic, you… you… <em>coward</em>!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “How dare you call <em>me</em> a coward! You are the pitiful one! So weak,
            so powerless! So utterly <em>useless</em> as to be nothing more  than a
            leech sucking the life from-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “That’s enough, Severus!” Remus shouted. “If you say one  more disparaging
            thing about Sirius, I will be the one that hexes you!” His  wand was raised
            steadfast before him, a fierce glint in his eyes. Tonks sat  immobilized beside him,
            unsure if any words were strong enough to dissuade her husband.  Sirius
            beamed at him. “Don’t. You’re just as bad as him.” Sirius looked  shocked.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Remus! How can you say that?! He’s… he’s,” Sirius gestured at Snape as if
            it were plainly obvious as to why the Greaseball were the scum of the
            earth.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I said, don’t.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “But-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “You heard Moony, Pads.” James had gently taken hold of his  best friend’s
            arm and was attempting to rest him onto his stool.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius, adrenaline still pumping, couldn’t stop himself from  shoving James
            away, who promptly lost his balance and fell flat on his arse.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Steady on!” Lily looked livid.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh, <em>FUCK</em> <em>OFF</em>, Evans!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus brandished his wand and pointed it directly over  Sirius’ heart.
            “You will not speak to her like that!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred watched, half-paralyzed as everyone around him joined  in the fray.
            Well, everyone except Albus, of course. He sat there with a  delightfully
            curious half-smile on his face as the others fell apart.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was shouting and attempted hexing and a lot more colourful  language
            than he’d ever heard before coming out of Lily’s mouth. He’d never  seen
            them this upset. It was time for Fred to put his foot down, and with that
            thought he cast a Sonorous charm on his throat.
        </p>
        <p>
            “<strong>QUIET!!!</strong>”
        </p>
        <p>
            In such a small space the sound was deafening and everyone,  except Albus
            who had readied himself with a pair of Dusky Pink earmuffs,  flinched,
            ducking their heads towards the ground. With the attention of the  entire
            room upon him, Fred began a speech reminiscent of one of the many he’d
            heard from his own mother.
        </p>
        <p>
            “That’s better. Now you can all listen instead of fighting.”  He let the
            silence continue for a beat, staring down his sheepish customers  each in
            turn before directing his attention towards the two great knob heads  still
            glaring at each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I cannot believe I’m about to say this but,” Fred took a  deep breath and
            slowly let it out. “settle down.” Another pause, another deep  breath. “In
            this establishment there are rules,” the words were desperately  scrambling
            to climb back into his mouth, “and everyone, <em>everyone</em>,” Fred  eyed
            the guilty duo, “must adhere to them.” There, he’d said it.
            <em>
                Wasn’t so  bad
            </em>
            .
        </p>
        <p>
            He continued staring at the rivals while leaning forward to  rest his hands
            on the countertop. “Now, I care deeply about you gents, but War Heroes  and
            Phoenix Veterans aside, I will toss you both out on your arses if you ever
            do this again.” Fred paused once more and sighed deeply. “And if that
            happens,  neither of you will be welcomed back here.”
        </p>
        <p>
            He had them at that. There wasn’t any other pub this side of  existence, as
            far as Fred knew, but even if there were, both parties would be  bereft
            leaving this place. Severus would miss out on socializing with Lily,  Sirius
            would lose his Marauder piss-ups.
        </p>
        <p>
            They were still staring at him, a wariness about them he  hadn’t seen
            before. Fred was rather pleased with that. Perhaps being a mother  hen
            wasn’t such a bad thing after all. Now that the recalcitrant pair were
            giving him their full attention, he could put part two of his ultimatum into
            play.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Sit down.” They sat. “You will agree not to antagonize each  other
            anymore.” They gaped. “Then you will shake hands and be done with it.”  They
            stiffened, then eyed each other suspiciously, as if they presumed one
            another of Confunding Fred.
        </p>
        <p>
            “It would be a wise decision indeed if you were to accept  Fred’s offer.”
            Cautioned Albus as he vanished his earmuffs wandlessly. “And for  both of
            you to learn how to discuss Harry and Draco without raising your voices.”
            Albus gave them a severe look over his half-moon specks, the twinkle gone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius sat there feeling like the ultimate fool. It had  boiled down to
            calling a ceasefire with Snape or being forced out of his comfy  pub. How
            would his reputation as a Bad Boy ever recover?! They expected him to  be
            defiant, to be bold and daring. They expected him to drive Snape up the wall
            and down the other side.
        </p>
        <p>
            Taunting him was the right thing to do, wasn’t it? Shouldn’t  he,
            <em>
                the
            </em>
            Sirius Black, provoke the Bat for the rest of their existence?  Argh, it was
            so frustrating! Sirius didn’t want to think about this anymore. He  was <em>
            tired</em>. Tired of coming up with all the schemes. Tired of niggling  and
            poking and prodding. Tired of bloody shouting at the man when he wouldn’t
            budge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Was that a sign, then? Should he truly abandon all his  hijinks and mayhem?
            Give up the fight? No. Sirius couldn’t let go of that,  surely. It was part
            of who he was, who everyone expected him to be. But then,  why were his
            friends turning against him? Even Remus was shying away from his  antics
            lately.
        </p>
        <p>
            The creeping unease of doubt was rising within his body,  threatening to
            overwhelm Sirius entirely. He’d felt this once before, when he’d  finally
            admitted to Harry and Remus years ago how much he regretted his rampant
            bullying. Of course, his verbal sparring with Snape in the Afterlife wasn’t
            anything  compared to those days, but it still troubled his mind in the
            quiet of night  where sleep eluded him. And he always found himself asking
            the same question. What  else was he to do?
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh, how he wished he could just retire from being a  Marauder! Then he’d
            never need to waste his time getting a rise out of Snape  again!
        </p>
        <p>
            In that moment, his mind cleared with the finality of a  Bludger to the
            head. He <em>could</em> retire, there was nothing stopping him  from doing
            it. And once he did, he’d never need to bother with the man again. He  would
            simply use this acquiescence as an excuse to keep his distance from Snape
            everywhere, all the time, for the rest of… well, forever. No more jabs, no
            more  quips. No reason to think of ever-evolving petulant nicknames. No need
            to  swagger and pontificate endlessly for the simplest of reactions. Sirius
            would  be free.
        </p>
        <p>
            But what if he got bored? Well, perhaps just a little  scheming now and then
            wouldn’t hurt? Yes, he could secretly stay a Marauder for  that, coming out
            of retirement to wreak havoc occasionally… briefly…  practically never. Just
            one or two little pranks at the Git’s expense outside  of the pub. With that
            final thought, Sirius began formulating his plan to exit  gracefully from
            the scene of tomfoolery against Snape, forever.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius had a flair for the dramatic, so obviously he would  need to do
            something grand. Not an easy feat when you are known far and wide  for your
            brilliant mischief making. He sat there silently, contemplating his
            possibilities while the room at large waited on him. No matter what scheme
            he  chose, he would need to make sure that Snape didn’t somehow get the
            upper hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Be bold, be daring, be dangerous…</em> <em>arrest their  senses</em>.
            Sirius barely stifled the small gasp that threatened to escape him  as the
            most bizarre thought of all crossed his mind.
            <em>
                Yes… that… that might  well do it.
            </em>
            The synapses in his mind were firing madly as his plan took  shape, the
            entire scenario unfolding before him in an instant.
        </p>
        <p>
            Something Sirius had never achieved during his short  lifetime…
        </p>
        <p>
            It was definitely bold, and obviously daring, and quite  possibly one of the
            most dangerous things he’d ever do. Sirius kept his face  impassive,
            repressing the smirk that wanted so badly to make itself known.
            <em>
                Be  brave, be fierce, be willing…quickly now, before you lose your
                nerve!
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Capitulate. Surrender to the man. Let Snape win, or rather,  let him
            <em>
                think
            </em>
            he’d won. Tricky, that. Ever so tricky. Sirius gathered  all his Gryffindor
            courage and sped forth before he could stop himself.
            <em>
                Bait  the hook…
            </em>
            “Why stop with a simple agreement, Fred? We all know what’s  really called
            for in this situation.” He waited as the silence pressed in  around him.
            “Shall I’ll be the bigger man and go first?” The Bat’s brows were  furrowed
            in utter confusion. Sirius tutted meekly. “Alright, then... Snape, I’d  like
            to offer you an apology. A proper one.” He did his best to look sincere,
            ashamed,  and ever determined to rectify his disrespectful behaviour.
            <em>
                Reel him in…
            </em>
            “I’m sorry…” he offered, his voice gentle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nearly everyone in the pub looked aghast at these two simple  words, with
            the exception once again being Albus as that curious half-smile  returned.
            Snape stared at Sirius as if he had lobsters crawling out of his  ears. Oh,
            what a look! Sirius would remember that one for eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
            A tiny flicker of something passed over Snape’s coal black  eyes then as he
            sat immobilized next to Sirius. Yes, a question. Sirius nearly  gave the
            game away with an impish grin but forced it down. This was the  delicate
            part after all, subtly was called for until he was ready to deliver  the
            next line. Once he did, the Bat would realize he’d been gulled just like
            any other day and Sirius could keep his dignity and his pub. Then,
            <em>
                then
            </em>
            he’d be done with all of it. He suppressed a shuttering breath at the
            thought. <em>Focus…</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            He looked Snape dead in the eyes, crossed his arms over his  chest, and
            addressed the man with as much haughty indifference as possible. “…for
            offending the world’s biggest prick without said appendage who will forever
            remain a Greasy Git with no understanding of human emotion.” Sirius’
            petulant  glare was just icing on the cake.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>There’s the rub!</em> Severus knew it! He knew that Black  was incapable
            of sincerity, of basic human decency! He’d almost believed the  idiot when
            he’d uttered those two little words.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus had been speechless in that moment, incapable of  processing the
            whole, bloody, thing. He’d never heard the man confess a real  apology… to
            anyone, let alone himself, the person that deserved it the most.  And Black
            just sat there as bold as brass with the ease of nonchalance as if he  did
            it every day!
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Shocked</em> was a lethal understatement. Severus  continued to sit
            rigidly from the utterance of those repentant words until he  realized with
            crushing finality, that he let his mask slip completely. Black  had done it
            again! Only this time, Severus had no idea how to reassemble his  shields.
            Never before had he been so utterly perplexed.
        </p>
        <p>
            And then, after a considerable pause in which Severus had  become aware that
            he was gaping like a dead fish at the pretentious fop, Black  spoke again.
            This time, however, he had used his accustomed rebuttal, and  Severus knew
            the bastard was just as petulant as ever.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mutt thought he was <em>so</em> clever with that. Apologizing
            without <em></em>apologizing. Yes, it probably cost the few precious brain
            cells  he had left. <em>Oh, how unfortunate.</em> Well, Severus could play
            that game,  too.
        </p>
        <p>
            He collected himself and gave the most venomous squint he  could muster.
            “And I apologize, Black, for the offence of bearing witness to your  obvious
            lack of intelligence, your insufferable fantasizing, your nauseating
            pomposity, your tasteless charm, your banal wit, and your being the greatest
            arsehole that has ever existed.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred stood there between the two rivals, glancing back and  forth at their
            exchange. Part of him wanted to lock this memory away in a  pensive for the
            rest of eternity, to preserve this incredible feat for future  generations
            to behold. The other part of him knew he had to act quickly to  preserve
            this temperamental state before it all went pear-shaped. He broke the
            silence. “Good enough. Now, shake hands.” He demanded.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both men jumped, having forgotten their audience, then  returned to their
            habitual glaring. It was a long moment indeed before either  of them moved,
            but when they did, it was in tandem.
        </p>
        <p>
            They simultaneously extended their arms and angled their  wrists, but each
            kept their fingers curled inward. Neither seemed willing to  continue the
            effort for they spent what felt like eons in the oppressive  silence simply
            analysing one another. Then suddenly both parties extended their  fingers to
            grasp the others offering hand and they shook hastily.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was over in an instant, their hands pulling away faster  than what seemed
            humanly possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus was looking anywhere but at the man sitting next to  him. He’d done
            it. Shaken the mongrel’s hand of his own free will- that time he’d  been
            conscripted by Albus in ’95 didn’t count- and lived to tell the tale. The
            fact that Black allowed it to happen astounded him. It wasn’t as if they
            needed  to join forces to stop a dark lord after all. The man’s acquiescence
            was truly  alarming. More alarming still was the mutt’s audaciousness that
            repeatedly  stunned him into silence that very afternoon. Something that
            never occurred  during their respective lifetimes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus’ hand felt heavier than before the shake, as if the  weight of
            Black’s were still present. That weight had definition, not merely a  lump
            but the outline of palm and fingers. Severus could even recall the warmth
            emanating from the contact and that there was the slightest hint of moisture
            present.
        </p>
        <p>
            At that moment, he realized he was actively cataloging these  little details
            and quickly banished all thoughts on the matter. Just for good  measure,
            Severus picked up his Glencairn and brought it to his lips, forcing  his
            mind to focus on how the glass felt in his hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius was staring at his lap, or rather, his hand resting  in his lap. It
            hadn’t been so bad after all. The shake. He thought for sure  he’d pull back
            to find a couple of fingers missing or perhaps merely a stump  would remain.
            Snape <em>actually</em> returned his gesture, shook his hand! And  they
            hadn’t needed the threat of an evil megalomaniac to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
            As he continued to stare at his unmarred appendage, Sirius  could feel the
            lingering traces of something… tingly at his fingertips. He  brushed his
            thumb over the soft pads of each digit several times. The strange  sensation
            was still there, almost as if Snape’s hand were touching his own at  that
            very moment. Baffling.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius continued tracing his thumb over the pad of his index  finger until
            the sensation finally ebbed away. It was a conundrum for sure.  What had
            caused such a phantom to manifest at their touch? Why did it persist so
            long after they parted?
        </p>
        <p>
            While he wanted very much to uproot this mystery and  discover what lay
            hidden, Sirius could not bear the thought of wanting to have  anything
            further to do with Snape. He was done with it, he reminded himself.  All of
            it. No time for ruminating on some strange, new device that would surely
            send him hurtling back into the thick of it. Sirius Black was done! Absolved
            from his charge of tormenting the Greasy Git for good.
        </p>
        <p>
            But… what had Albus said? ‘<em>discuss Harry and Draco  without raising your
            voices’</em>… Well… technically… that <em>would </em>be an  entirely new sort
            of arrangement. They could have a civil conversation. Completely  different
            from anything they’d ever engaged in before. Yes, that might be  alright. A
            conversation, a talk, a chat. Just a chat. No jibes. A chat. Sirius  could
            handle that, of course he could. Civil.
        </p>
        <p>
            He looked at his palm and began what he hoped would be a  new, completely
            different, not-having-anything-to-do-with-the-man, just a chat,
            <em>
                sort of
            </em>
            , conversation. “Snape?”
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Damn the mutt</em>. Severus was trying not to clench his  jaw and
            failing. He had hoped that their dispute was over for good. Apparently,
            Black had other ideas. He suppressed the thought of throttling the man so he
            could finish his drink in peace and instead reminded himself that Lily was
            in  the same space as he and that was all that mattered. “Yes, Black?” he
            snipped.
        </p>
        <p>
            “What do you have against them, really?” Sirius was  surprised by the
            restraint in his own voice. He’d hoped to come across as calm  and
            collected, not quite so timid, but perhaps that would work in his favour.
            The  ‘Romance of Harry and Draco’ was a delicate subject after all.
        </p>
        <p>
            When he glanced up to look upon the stoic man next to him,  he was further
            surprised to see that he wasn’t sneering or glaring or in some  other
            derisive fashion. Snape sat there just as calmly as himself, staring off
            into the distance, Glencairn resting in his hand just below his lip.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Nothing in particular.” Severus replied nonchalantly,  setting his drink
            down at last while keeping his eyes trained on the wall  before him. He was
            unnerved by the gentle tone that Black used for his  question. Was he merely
            curious or was this another ploy of the unhinged man to  lure Severus into a
            devious trap? He couldn’t be sure. Gesticulating and  raving, those actions
            were easily deciphered. Not this temperate attitude. It  was a contradiction
            to everything Severus had ever experienced with Black. He  would need to
            tread carefully lest this new terrain become quicksand and  swallow him
            whole.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once again, Severus decided to play along, and with any luck  and enough of
            his Slytherin cunning, this time he would beat Black at his own  game. “But
            surely, even you must realize that Draco is a <em>Malfoy</em>. He  cannot
            simply abandon his upbringing and social status as you once did.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius scoffed. “It’s really not that difficult. You just  tell everyone to
            fuck off and be done with it.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus had to clamp his mouth shut to keep from slinging an  insult at the
            idiot. When he finally turned to face the mutt, he noted only  mild
            irritation on the man’s face. He huffed before continuing his explanation.
            “He is a pureblood of the highest pedigree. He was raised by illustrious
            purebloods with that same pedigree. There is no known trace of madness nor
            any  other affliction within recent history belonging to his paternal
            ancestry-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Ah, but the maternal line’s another story, isn’t it?”  Sirius supplied
            triumphantly, folding his arms across his chest. He hated  admitting such a
            thing, but the Snake was making such a fuss over ‘purity’. If  he could turn
            away from such a disgraceful and disgusting family, so could his  young
            cousin.
        </p>
        <p>
            “And have you forgotten how the bloodlines work?” Severus  added
            impatiently. “I can’t imagine so, knowing that it was drilled into you
            relentlessly as a child by your psychotic, blood-supremacist parents.”
            Black’s  face twitched at that, and Severus knew if he pushed it much
            further, they’d be  right back to fighting again. He forced himself to take
            a deep, steadying  breath and continued with his elucidation. “Regardless of
            Draco’s maternal  lineage, it would have been elevated to the same status as
            that of his father’s  when Narcissa married Lucious.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Black grunted his acknowledgement and Severus continued. “The  Malfoys are
            not simply part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, they are a globally  renowned
            family, with financial ties to nearly every part of the world. Every
            wizarding person of high social standing knows who they are, even if they
            know  very little about the specifics of our society in Britain.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius huffed. “Your point?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “My point-” Severus began again, trying to keep the hard  edge out of his
            voice, “is that even with both wars and the suspicious nature  of their
            actions, their pristine standing was not entirely destroyed. And  coupled
            with the extensive reparations and often magnanimous charitable
            contributions by all three members of the family, they have been elevated
            even  higher in society. No one cares to remember anything other than their
            generosity and selflessness in such a time of need.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Money isn’t everything.” Sirius grumbled.
        </p>
        <p>
            “No. It’s not. But the world rarely sees it any other way  and that is why
            Draco will always be a Malfoy. His position does not allow for  him to
            easily… fraternize with Harry Potter.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Harry saved all of Britian! That must count for something.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Not to most blood-purists, nor to many other socialites.  Draco’s
            negligence would be highly irritating to them at best, and something to  be
            dealt with at worst.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius couldn’t help but growl. “It’s all a load of bollocks!  Harry and
            Draco are adults and can do whatever they damn well please.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “And you think that includes a romantic entanglement? When  have they ever
            shown even the slightest interest in one another?” Severus  couldn’t help
            but sneer.
        </p>
        <p>
            “They just haven’t found the right opportunity yet. Once  they do, you’ll
            eat your words.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus was rapidly losing patience with the mongrel. “They  have no cause
            to interact with each other outside of official Ministry  functions.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “They could always just randomly bump into each other-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “And they have nothing in common.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Opposites attract and-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “And their history during Hogwarts was tumultuous at best.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “So? People change. They’re adults now, like I said.  Completely different-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “AND…" Severus cut him off once more, raising his voice- not quite shouting,
            but not far off- in the hopes that Black would shut up and actually listen
            to him this time. It worked. The mutt sat there with his arms crossed and his
            nostrils flared, an irritated little sneer on his face. Feeling assured that
            Black would not interrupt again, he continued. "Harry has a family to think of
            now. Draco and Astoria  have yet to produce the Malfoy heir, which, as purebloods
            of such immense  importance within the community, will be their only focal point
            until they are successful in their endeavor. Do you honestly believe that either
            of these young men, even if they were capable, would dishonor their commitments?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius was silent after that. He knew Harry would never walk  away from the
            loving relationship he had worked hard to build; he would never  abandon
            them. And Draco, well, he didn’t really know the lad, but Snape was  right,
            family was everything to a Malfoy. Besides, if the respective parties
            weren’t currently open to multiple partnerships, it would only hurt everyone
            involved. He didn’t want that for any of them. But… Sirius knew he was right
            about those two, it was bound to happen sooner or later, regardless of
            whatever  Snape felt about it.
        </p>
        <p>
            He sighed. This was the same old argument, and it was  getting rather
            tiresome. Sirius had to figure out a way to convince Snape that  it would
            still happen someday. Then, the Git would have to finally shut up  about it
            and let him gloat in peace. “No. They would never hurt their partners  and
            children like that. But, who’s to say that their perspectives on what
            constitutes a relationship won’t change. You can’t deny all those moments
            they  share together on The Board.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus scoffed. “That is certainly a stretch, Black.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “No, it’s not!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes, it is! Do you see anything up there to indicate a romantic  liaison of
            any kind?” Severus glared at him indignantly.
        </p>
        <p>
            “No!” Sirius shouted. “But the bloody thing never shows that  sort of
            stuff!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “It does for other people.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “That’s different!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “<em>How</em> exactly is it different, Black? That Board has  it all laid
            bare before you… and look, nothing but ‘meetings’ and ‘functions’.”  Severus
            gestured to the blasted thing on the wall.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I already told you it doesn’t show the details-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “It does if you know how to look for them.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius was appalled. “I don’t want to see any of <em>that</em>!  Are you
            telling me that you do?!”
        </p>
        <p>
            It was Severus’ turn to be appalled. “Of course not!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Ha!” Sirius had him at that. “Then how can you be certain  there isn’t
            anything happening at those ‘<em>functions</em>’?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus hated being caught out, especially by the mangy  pureblood. “It will
            never be anything more than a nod and a handshake.” He  growled.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius’ face fell. Why couldn’t the bastard understand? What  else could he
            say to convince him? Oh, what a wretched day this was turning out  to be!
            His upset must have shown on his face because Snape shifted  uncomfortably
            next to him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus, for the love of Merlin, could not puzzle out what  prompted him to
            respond the way he did next but before he could register his  actions, he
            said, not unkindly, “However, one cannot discount the laws of  probability,
            no matter how impossible something might seem.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius’ mouth fell open in surprise at that concession. <em></em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Shit</em>. Yet another slip. Severus had to cover his  tracks, quickly.
            “Of course, Harry has never been one for intelligent pursuits  and often
            blunders head-first into situations that he can neither predict nor
            control. The consequences of his actions are such that even if he did manage
            to  make something plausible happen between himself and Draco, he would cock
            it up  royally in the end.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Hopefully that was enough to make the pureblood back off,  but just for good
            measure, and he was loathe to do it, Severus added, “And the  same can be
            said for Draco. So, if they could accomplish anything at all  together, it
            would be that they are both utterly hopeless at romance.” Severus  took his
            final sip of whiskey and placed the empty glass upon the countertop.  Fred
            tipped the bottle towards him, and Severus gave a minute nod in return. He
            would need another drink if Black continued on in his usual fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius couldn’t help it. He tried to let it go and change  the subject but
            his fixation with Harry and Draco would not go away. “But what  about fate,
            then, huh?” He asked, sipping from his tumbler once more. “So,  maybe
            neither of them ever plans to make any kind of move and it still happens
            anyway?” Sirius took a sip and raised his eyebrows, daring Snape to counter
            his  logic.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I suppose that is one interpretation. Be that as it may,  the chances of it
            happening would still be so astronomically low that it would,  most likely,
            pass them by in their lifespans.” Severus rebutted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius just stared at the man, his mouth parted slightly,  and his brows
            knitted in bewilderment. “Don’t you want them to be happy? Don’t  they
            deserve it while they’re still alive and well?” He asked desperately.
        </p>
        <p>
            "……"
        </p>
        <p>
            "……"
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus examined the amber liquid in his glass intently and  took a
            generous, silent sip.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius slammed his fist down on the countertop. “Oh, come  on, Snape! Part
            of you must be just the littlest bit of a hopeless romantic.  Why not let go
            and feel happy for someone else for a change?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus began reciting the twelve uses for dragon’s blood in  his head. It
            was the only thing to keep him from grinding his teeth into dust  as Black
            weathered his remaining fortitude. He was truly sick of speculating on  an
            entirely theoretical relationship between two people that could not be more
            dissimilar to each other. What could he possibly do to stop this confounded
            fool? Agree with him? Never!
        </p>
        <p>
            Somehow, Severus found himself acquiescing to the mad notion  before he
            could stop it. “If you promise not to be so overbearing with this  obsession
            of yours then I will concur that yes, maybe, there is a chance for  them to
            be happy together,<em> someday</em>”. Another silent sip.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I knew it! I told you love conquers all!’ Sirius picked up  his glass and
            had it halfway to his lips before-
        </p>
        <p>
            “What did I just say, Black?” Severus warned. A dark glint  in his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Alright.” Sirius snorted.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mongrel sat there as smug as anything, with that  self-satisfied grin on
            his pretentious face. Finally, Severus would get some  peace and hopefully
            never hear another word on the subject again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, he realized that if the mutt wasn’t talking about  Draco and Harry,
            he’d just find something else to pester him with until his  mind completely
            melted from the stupidity of it all. And it would most likely  be talk of
            how miserably lonely he was without his Chew-Toy hanging off his  every word
            and action. Better to nip that one in the bud before it could blossom.
        </p>
        <p>
            “And you shouldn’t worry about being alone, either.” Severus  remarked in
            what he hoped was a casual manner. “It’s really not all that bad.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius couldn’t help the way his mouth was hanging open like  a goldfish,
            his glass still forgotten midway to his lips. “How can you say  that!? How
            can you sit there and tell me that being lonely is a good thing?!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Easily.” Severus replied, pressing the matter. He then  turned toward the
            wizened headmaster for reinforcement of this argument. “Albus,  you don’t
            mind being alone, do you?”
        </p>
        <p>
            The old man chuckled. “Not anymore, but I’ve had a long time  to get used to
            the idea.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “There, you see. Simple as that, Black.” Severus smirked.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Of course,” Albus continued, “I was young once, too, and  for a time, not
            alone. It was rather a difficult turning point in my life, but  I would not
            have traded the feeling of being loved, however misunderstood it  was at the
            time, for anything in the world.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus pursed his lips then drained his remaining whiskey  in one gulp.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius chuckled and threw back his own drink. “Well, then.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Bugger off, Black.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Ha!” Sirius continued to chuckle quietly beside his  brooding enemy,
            savouring this moment and filing it away for later. Then  something occurred
            to him that he’d never given any thought to before. Pensively,  he added,
            “You’re all alone, all the time. That must be difficult.” He could  see
            Snape tensing out of the corner of his eye. “I mean, I’m only ever alone
            part of the time, and I can’t stand it. Absolutely hate it, in fact.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Don’t you dare to pity me, Black!” Severus snarled. He  would not allow
            this fool to probe the matter any further.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Alright! Don’t get your knickers in a twist!” Sirius put  his palms up
            before the irate Bat next to him. “It was merely an observation.”  Snape had
            reacted viciously to that notion, and Sirius couldn’t help but wonder  if
            the man was just as bereft as he was at times. That was rather… gloomy.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, Sirius did not pity Snape, no, never pity. It felt more  like
            comradery, a kinship, even. They were both facing a similar situation, what
            with the whole being lonely business, and they both had oodles of time on
            their  hands. “I suppose you and I aren’t really all that different. Both
            knocking  about in the same, shapeless place forever more, being alone and
            miserable.  We’re rather a pair, aren’t we?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus curled his lip in disdain. “How utterly disturbing.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius chuckled again, but without any of his usual bite. He  was still
            caught up in that rather interesting thought. <em>A pair</em>. Hmmm…
            disturbing. Very disturbing. Wasn’t it? But what if- No. No, surely not…
        </p>
        <p>And yet…</p>
        <p>
            Sirius carefully glanced to his left again, studying his  childhood nemesis
            from the corner of his eye more intently than he’d ever done  before. He
            watched as Snape took another slow and deliberate sip, his firm, yet  supple
            lip lingering at the rim of the glass momentarily before pulling away.
            <em>
                When  did that happen? Weren’t his lips always thin and menacing? Oh,
                right! Must have  been all that sneering distorting them so.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Snape spent what felt like an eternity savoring the liquid  in his mouth,
            then suddenly swallowed. The unmarred column of his pale neck  showing just
            enough above his high collar that Sirius could see the muscles  shift and
            the bob of his Adam’s Apple. Such a mundane thing and yet… The effect  lent
            itself to other possibilities in his mind. <em>Oh, Merlin.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Ok, Sirius realized, he’d let himself get carried away. That  was an easy
            thing to do when you were bored, and possibly a little desperate.  But there
            was nothing, <em>nothing</em> that should have prompted <em>that sort</em>
            of astute observation of <em>Snape</em>. It was wrong on so many levels, and
            not  something he would ever entertain for any reason. Ever. In fact, Sirius
            told  himself, as he would never contemplate such a thing, the thought was
            actually  quite harmless. It wasn’t as if it would ever happen again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pale… Supple… Strong. Lithe. Neck, lips, hands, body. Manipulating-
            heaving- writhing against-
            <em>
                Ahh! No!... No, no, no, no, not that! Never that!  Never. Never. Never.
            </em>
            His imagination had gone far enough for one eternity.  Sirius had to put
            those entirely unwelcome thoughts from his mind immediately  and
            permanently. They had no business being there. None at all. Their
            persistence would only pollute his sanity until there was nothing left!
            Sirius  could not allow that. <em>Pull yourself together, man!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            But…
        </p>
        <p>
            But…
        </p>
        <p>
            With great effort, he forced himself to breathe deeply and  approach this
            matter clinically. That was the best way to deal with a problem  of this
            magnitude. Right, so, what exactly was he looking at? A man, yes, but  what
            sort? There wasn’t anything truly remarkable about him, surely, otherwise
            Sirius would have discovered that ages ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, what were the glaringly conspicuous things that made him  so ordinary,
            then? His nose for a start. It was his most prominent feature.  There wasn’t
            a person in existence who would forget that whopper upon his face.  Sirius
            studied the contours of Snape’s nose intently.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sharp hook that had, in his youth, made Snape look more  like a bird of
            prey than a boy was no longer quite so impressive. His high  cheekbones had
            managed to balance out his features rather well since then,  giving the man
            a distinguished appearance. Aquiline and chiseled. Unwavering.  Solid. Just
            like the man himself. Why hadn’t Sirius ever noticed that before?
            <em>
                What  else have I been missing all this time?
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Well…. Moving on. Snape’s hair. It was the butt of many  jokes and played
            heavily in the roll of some of the Marauder’s pranks. How many  times had
            Sirius referred to him as the Greasy Git when they were at school? It  was
            practically slimy back then. But now… <em>now</em>, it appeared almost silky
            in the lamp light. But that couldn’t be right, could it? Sirius wasn’t sure,
            but it didn’t <em>look</em> greasy or grimy from where he was sitting. He
            barely  resisted the urge to run his fingers through it and test his theory.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alright. So those physical barriers were dismantled, but  there were plenty
            of other things wrong with Snape, he was sure of it. Sirius  looked the man
            up and down. He was lanky… No, that wasn’t right either. Perhaps  he had
            been at school, but not anymore. Even with his billowing robes hindering  a
            proper assessment, Sirius could tell there was an underlying confidence to
            Snape, much like a runner’s build.
            <em>
                Probably acquired that during those long years  of playing double agent.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Hmm… he smelled… bad? Nope. Once again, his previous odor  was probably due
            to his involvement with various potion ingredients and  hovering over a lit
            cauldron all day long.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ah, his teeth! …. Sirius sighed. He’d never really cared  about that one at
            all. In fact, if he were truly honest with himself,  appearances made very
            little difference in the long run. Although, that might  have been because
            he was just a tab bit self-absorbed, and he knew he was  radiant enough for
            an entire room full of people. But with Snape, well, it had  to make a
            difference. It helped to keep their hatred for each other going.  Which was
            important. Very important. <em>Wait, why was it important?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius didn’t want to delve too deeply into that one. He  could feel the
            weight of it pushing against the barrier of his mind even now,  ready to
            break forth if he so much as tapped at the keystone. He had to stop  this
            train of thought before he allowed himself to go completely mad from it.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, what? He no longer had the excuse of a physical  repulsion to the man.
            That made no difference. He still hated that self-assured,  forceful stride,
            and the passionate sneers and snark and constant insults, and  the way his
            inviting lips curled when he was excited, and when he tantalizingly  raised
            his eyebrow before he was about to berate someone, and that velvety hum  of
            his voice as he preyed upon a weak point in the conversation, and those
            fathomless pools of onyx that held a secret no person could ever hope to
            decipher with his gift for Occlumency, <em>and</em> Legilimency,
            <em>
                and
            </em>
            Dueling, with those <em>hands</em>, those <em>bloody dexterous hands</em>
            that  could-. <em>Oh, Fuck, fuck, fuckity-FUCK!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            It was truly maddening. He, Sirius Black was mad. Utterly,  completely,
            stupidly mad for having such thoughts. Yes, that was the truth of  it, he’d
            gone completely round the twist contemplating such dangerous things  that
            should never have been contemplated in the first place.
            <em>
                Dangerous… Very  dangerous…
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius sat quietly for a long moment with a rather odd look  on his face,
            staring at the wall before him. He tilted his head to the side,  furrowing
            his brows in concentration. <em>In for a Knut…</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            None of this went unnoticed by Fred, who was still polishing  the same mug
            he’d started on a half hour ago. Sirius pushed his empty tumbler  toward
            him automatically, his eyes focused on something unseen, and Fred
            begrudgingly passed him a new one.
        </p>
        <p>
            As he returned to his half-hearted task of polishing, Fred  studied the
            proud Gryffindor before him. He could practically see the gears  turning
            inside Sirius’ head as a flash of something mad stole across his face,  and
            the familiar twinge of magic filled the air. Fred was standing close enough
            that he could feel the erratic prickling all over his skin and hastily
            wondered  if the others sensed it as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Something was about to happen, though Fred was unsure what  the outcome
            might be. Sirius was often spontaneous and although they could  usually
            predict his turns, they still had trouble keeping pace with him. What  was
            going on inside that head of his to cause such a strong reaction? He hoped
            it wouldn’t be anything explosive, having to rebuild his pub from little
            bits  and pieces would be a nightmare. Whatever it was, Fred was sure they’d
            all find  out soon enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suddenly, the tension that was building all around them  dissolved and the
            distant look in Sirius’ eyes faded away to reveal their  familiar gleaming
            intensity. He was entirely too calm as he brought his tumbler  to his lips,
            draining it in one swallow.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Snape?” Sirius ventured quietly, keeping his eyes trained  on the empty
            glass in his own hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes?” Severus replied equally quiet, only a hint of disdain  clipping the
            word. He didn’t like Black’s tone. There was something troubling  in its
            wake, something he’d not care to examine nor wish to facilitate in its
            passing as it stretched out before him.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Can I buy you a drink?” Sirius asked timidly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus nearly dropped his Glencairn. He turned ever so  slowly towards
            Black, his eyes narrowing to mere slits. “Why?” he asked, his  voice
            gravely, barely above a whisper.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Well, that’s what friends do, don’t they?” Sirius stated as  if this were
            obvious even for a toadstool.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the room wasn’t quiet before, it certainly was now. Fred  abandoned the
            pretense of polishing his mug all together.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Friends?</em> Severus was speechless. Again. It was  becoming far too
            commonplace for his liking, and he swore to himself that it  would end here
            and now. His barbed tongue was poised to deliver a scathing  rebuttal, but
            his mind forced himself to dissect the meaning behind the word  that Black
            had so carelessly thrown at him.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Friends?</em> What in all of Hades had convinced the man  that they were
            anything other than heated rivals? Not one day passed without  them trying
            to goad each other into paroxysm or hex each other out of existence.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Friends?</em> They utterly loathed one another.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Friends?</em> How could the man be so idiotic as to even  suggest that
            such a thing was possible between them?
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Friends?</em> No one would ever believe it.
        </p>
        <p>
            These thoughts commandeered all his leverage and turned his  insults to
            sludge in his mouth. When Severus finally found his voice again, he  said
            the only plausible thing that came to mind. “We are not friends, Black.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Well,” Sirius focused on an errant piece of lint down the  front of his
            shirt, “maybe we could be. I mean, after all, we’re just floating  around
            here with nothing better to do. We should commiserate together.” He  flicked
            the lint away without looking up. He hoped his words would come off as
            sincere, but seeing as this was a whole new experience for him with regards
            to  Snape, he highly doubted it.
        </p>
        <p>
            What was Black playing at? He would never be so humble nor  so genuine as to
            offer Severus such an enterprise. There must be a catch  somewhere, but the
            tangled threads were weaved together in such a relentless  fashion that
            Severus could not begin to pick them apart. Well, he’d played  along thus
            far, hadn’t he? He would simply need to bide his time before  striking back
            against his tormentor. “A drink?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “You… want… to buy me… a drink?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “And you think this is an appropriate action to take…  because you believe
            we are <em>friends</em>?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Why would you assume that we are <em>friends</em>?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I’ve already told you. We have the same issue for once- as  ghastly as that
            sounds- and we need a little mutual support, don’t you think?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “……”
        </p>
        <p>
            “We’re in the same boat… Like a pair of old shoes? Birds of  a feather… um,
            swimming upstream, or, well… Ah! Two peas in a pod! That’s it!  Yeh, we’re
            um… like two peas… in a pod.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Peas?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “<em>Peas?</em>”
        </p>
        <p>
            “YES! You idiot! And I think we deserve a drink together!”  Sirius shouldn’t
            have shouted, but the man was making this so bloody difficult  and all over
            a harmless little drink.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Just a drink, then.” Severus’s glared at him accusingly,  his tone finite.
            He applauded his own efforts at resisting to hex the mutt.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius looked at him incredulously. “Of course! I wasn’t  implying anything
            else.” Was he? Possibly- No! Well, maybe? Is that how it  sounded to Snape?
            He’d only meant… but if the man thought… and if somehow  things did… Was
            that wrong? <em>Shit</em>. Sirius was truly bollocking this whole  thing up.
            And now he was blushing like a bloody third year in front of him as  well.
            <em>Wonderful.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            “I should hope not.” Severus snipped suggestively. The words  were out of
            his mouth before he could stop them, the honeyed undercurrent  utterly
            foreign to his usual disposition. <em>What the hell am I doing?</em> His
            response made it sound as if he were actively contemplating Black’s bizarre
            euphemism! It would <em>never happen</em>, no matter how desperate he was
            for  companionship. His mental faculties could be in tatters and Severus
            would still  not yield to something so unpalatable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Black was a violent, petulant, imbecilic nuisance that he  wanted nothing to
            do with whatsoever.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus forced himself to slow his breathing and analyse the  situation.
            What was Black really insinuating? Surely, it couldn’t be anything  as
            absurd as… Severus was doing his level best to ignore the many thoughts that
            seemed to plague him all at once. He would not allow himself to entertain
            such  a notion, he simply wouldn’t.
        </p>
        <p>
            He rationalised that this must all be part of the insidious  game that Black
            was playing, to which he should continue his own part to  uncover the plot.
            That helped to ground him. Yes, Severus was feeling more in  control by the
            second, his focus returning tenfold, and he vowed to see this  despicable
            charade come to an end.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was a spy after all. So many years of careful observation  gave his mind
            a granite edge and now he would harness that ability to dismantle  Black.
            Stealthily he peered through the curtain of raven hair surrounding his  face
            and <em>observed</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Black was off with the fairies, staring at that ridiculous  Board on the
            wall before him. <em>Perfect.</em> Severus allowed himself to  continue
            cataloging his thoughts from earlier when their hands had met briefly.  That
            same hand was fitted loosely around his empty glass, his forefinger
            occasionally running a languid circle around the rim. The movement bared his
            wrist with each turn, allowing a small runic tattoo to peek out from his
            well-tailored leather jacket before disappearing again up his sleeve.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus wondered what it would be like to brush his thumb  across the dark
            ink, to trace its outline, to press ever so slightly against it  until he
            could feel the man’s pulse hammering beneath. Now that was a dangerous
            thought. It led to more dangerous thoughts, things he could never admit to
            himself before.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus was not blind, nor was he stupid. No one could deny  the allure that
            Black possessed. His immaculate, luminous hair. His radiant  gaze. That
            sinuously lithe build and firm backside. Those were merely the tip  of the
            iceberg for the unfathomable list of Black’s physical traits. And he was
            not advanced by his looks alone, no, despite Severus’ insistence that Black
            was  a complete idiot, he was clever enough to be a top student year after
            year. And  that charming, charismatic aura of his was… overwhelming, to say
            the least.
        </p>
        <p>
            Black’s boundless energy that seeped into everything around  him, consuming
            and roiling with its infectious fervor, was most probably the  worst of it.
            Severus could feel the suffocating constraints of it all around  him
            whenever Black was nearby. He’d tread against it from the time he was
            eleven years old, barely keeping his head above water, never knowing when
            he’d  finally succumb from sheer exhaustion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Black was an enigma, a loathsome and despicable one that  Severus should
            never have put such consideration into, but like everyone else  he was swept
            away by the man’s prowess. Oh, it was infuriating that a person  could be
            so, so… fascinating to anyone!
            <em>
                Not unlike the other one you cannot  admit to having noticed these past
                ten years.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The silence around them was palpable but neither man seemed  to notice. Fred
            gave them each a refill and quietly began polishing another  glass. Both men
            sat in silence as they absorbed their drinks.
        </p>
        <p>
            After several minutes of deathly quiet from the room, Sirius  finally
            cleared his throat and asked, “But if I was, what exactly would I have  to
            do to warrant such a thing?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Even in death Severus was surprised by the deranged man’s  gall. Did he
            truly mean exploits beyond that of a simple drink? It was  preposterous!
            “You mean, a <em>date</em>?” he asked perplexedly, disbelief  clearly etched
            in his features.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Maybe.” Sirius was still looking at the front of his shirt,  searching for
            another piece of nonexistent lint to brush away.
            <em>
                What the fuck  am I doing?!
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>What the fuck is he doing?</em> Severus carefully scrutinised  Black,
            looking for the trap he knew was waiting for him. It must be there
            somewhere, but as he continued to observe, he saw only the man, a rather
            anxious looking one at that. The fidgeting, the fixation over his clothes,
            the  gentle tremor of his fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus could barely contain the gasp threatening to escape  him. Black was
            serious. <em>Oh, I</em> hate <em>that stupid joke!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Black wanted… more? Impossible! This was mad, all of it! But  he’d sworn to
            see this through. What if there was no scheme? What if something  else did
            manifest between them? Severus’ curiosity was threatening to overwhelm  him
            entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
            He decided on a new tactic, one that hopefully would oust  the mutt if he
            were up to no good. And if he was, Severus would flay him for  it. If he
            wasn’t…, could he go through the motions with Black and his farse of  a
            date? Would it go further still? In that moment, Severus no longer cared,
            the  intrigue was too great for him. <em>Let the true games begin.</em> “One
            drink  does not constitute a date.” He quipped before polishing off his
            scotch.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius’s head shot up to look at the Board in front of him. “Alright  then,
            just for curiosities sake, what <em>would</em> be your idea of a date?” <em>
            He  hasn’t hexed me yet.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Severus felt almost giddy as he watched Black squirm in his  seat. He liked
            that, and wondered what else might make him squirm if…
        </p>
        <p>
            Like the snake he was, Severus slowly slithered towards to  his prey,
            closing what distance remained between them, and whispered <em>ideas</em>
            into his ear.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sirius’ eyes widened almost imperceptibly, his pupils  dilating from the
            deep, velvety tone supplying such wicked thoughts to his  mind. He could not
            suppress the shutter that overcame him. <em>This is madness.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred’s face was redder than his hair, having stood just  close enough to
            somehow overhear the last few secret words. Some things should  not be known
            about one’s professor. Ever. He quickly turned to finish polishing  the
            glass elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            Silence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Still, more silence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tonks cleared her throat. “I’ll have another one of those  fizzy things,
            Fred. Albus, you?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Why thank you, Dora. They really are quite refreshing.”  Albus said,
            keeping his eyes trained on the two men at the other end of the  bar.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Another gin and tonic for you, Remus? James, again? Oh,  Lily, you’ve
            barely touched yours. Here, have a fresh ale.” Fred bustled about,  ignoring
            the silent parties, and things returned to their jovial state once  again.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a few minutes Severus quietly took his leave of them.  Stunned, Sirius
            barely noticed the flutter of black fabric before it  disappeared beyond the
            door. He sat there, arguing with himself, occasionally  muttering something,
            or fidgeting with his hands. Another minute- or perhaps a year-  passed,
            before Sirius chuckled quietly to himself and left the pub without  saying
            goodbye.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the door closed behind the enthusiastic Gryffindor  everyone exhaled
            audibly, relief flooding through them at last.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Merlin, I thought that’d never happen!” Fred bellowed.
        </p>
        <p>
            “It’s been a long time coming.” Laughed James before  squeezing his wife
            around the middle to steady himself.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Love conquers all!” Lily leaned into James’ embrace and  sighed. “I never
            understood how the houses could be so divided.” She mused.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remus sat quietly, his eyes trained on the tiny bubbles  dancing about in
            the untouched glass before him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tonks threaded her fingers through her husbands. “Are you  alright?” she
            asked him, knowing the cause for his reservations.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes.” He replied with a gloomy look behind his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
            “You’re not feeling a bit jealous, are you?” Tonks wrapped  her arms around
            Remus’s neck and hugged him tightly.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Maybe just a little.” Remus wanted to say more, but his  thoughts were too
            disheveled. He was worried that it might not go well for  Sirius or Severus.
            He desperately wanted them to work it out. He needed them to  work it out.
            He cared too much about both of them for this not to work out. “We’ve  all
            led such complicated lives.” Remus stared knowingly into Tonks’ eyes before
            placing a gentle kiss to her lips. “If anyone deserves to be happy, it’s
            them.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Tonks smiled lovingly back at Remus, an impish quirk to her  smile. “You
            know you could join them right now and neither would turn you away.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Remus chuckled, nervously. “Not sure if we’re there yet,  love. Besides, they
            each need time to figure this whole thing out.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Tonks gave him that same pitying look that James used on  Sirius.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remus rushed to reassure her. “Next time, perhaps. If all  goes well.” he
            stated, wondering- not for the first time- just how the three of  them would
            manage. Then before he could stop himself, he added anxiously, “It  will go
            well, won’t it? They’re not going to destroy one another in the  process?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Of course, love. They’re both stubborn as Hell, but they’ll  get through
            this. It’s on the Borad, remember?” Tonks replied mirthfully. The  crinkle
            at the corner of her eyes showed her excitement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remus couldn’t help his own delightful smile.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Alright, everyone!” Fred announced, pulling a small Scoreboard  from under
            the counter. The secret one. The one that neither Sirius nor Severus  had
            ever known about. “Let’s see if anyone had them down for today.” He glanced
            at the bets and sure enough there was an enormous sum placed on the current
            date. “Oh, I should have known! Albus, you win again. You’re always right,
            you  know.” Fred scoffed, shaking his head.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I may have had my fair share of good guesses over the  years, Fred, but I
            would never presume to be right in all things.” Albus  corrected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fred chuckled. “Fair enough. Well, what do you want to do  with your
            winnings?” His wand was pointed at the secret Scoreboard, ticking off  the
            long-awaited victory.
        </p>
        <p>
            “As always, please redistribute them back into this  establishment so the
            esteemed patrons can partake of more free drink.” Albus  held out his palms
            in kindness.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Cheers!” Everyone shouted at the brilliant headmaster.
        </p>
        <p>
            Albus blushed. “It’s nothing really. I just love happy  endings.”

            <strong>End Notes:</strong> Manchurian Tung Oil is a fictional  product derived
            from a film and the title of this story was inspired by an  American
            sitcom’s theme song. The tucking of beards and “lobsters” are also
            references to a book and a film, respectively. Ten points if you guessed them
            all correctly! I used hex code for most of the colours in this story,
            many of which  are not officially recognized, so I gave them my own names to
            fit with Fred’s  eccentric taste (see end notes for more details). I have
            always found interior-design  colour schemes of the 1970’s to be
            particularly disturbing, so why should  Sirius and Remus be any different?
            Oh, and Sirius is not an alcoholic, his  tolerance is just quite high.
