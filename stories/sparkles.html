    <strong>Notes:</strong> English is my first language,  but I have done my
    very best to roughly translate Icelandic, Castilian,  and Rotuman
    words for elements of this story. Also, there's quite a bit of West Country
    dialogue from Hagrid, which I have attempted to present authentically. My
    sincerest apologies in advance to anyone who may feel offended by any
    unintentional misinterpretation or misrepresentation of said languages and dialogue.
</p>
<p class="notes">
    <strong>Additional Notes:</strong> The  following passage was inspired by my
    partner, who upon hearing about this story  of mine, decided to wax
    Poe-etic. I just had to add it! Based on the words of  the notoriously
    wronged Montresor from Edgar Allan Poe’s <em>The Cask of  Amontillado</em>.
    I hope you enjoy this tiny snippet of Snape’s unending torment  at the
    School for Dunderheads.

<p class="chapterTitle">Prologue</p>
<img class="pageBreak" src="../images/HP_Page%20Break_Transparent_Large_Purple.png">


<p class="firstP" id="sparklesFirstP">
    Severus was <em>FURIOUS!</em>
</p>

<p id="secondP">
    No. Furious was not strong enough of a word to describe  the hellish wrath
    that consumed him. It was a much deeper, more sinister  feeling. Something
    to steal one’s breath, melt their skin, turn their bones to  dust! His blood
    boiled with it! Flames upon his body! Only sheer determination  of will kept
    Severus from exuding literal trails of fire in his wake as he  strode with
    lethal conviction through the castle.
</p>
<p>
    This was the fifth time in two days that those horridly  wretched, utterly
    despicable, migraine-inducing, evil little Weasley Twins had got  the better
    of him, and Severus would be damned if he’d let them get away with  it for a
    moment longer!
</p>
<p>
    If it had only been the torment of those blasted <em>flowers</em>,  he might
    have been capable of letting it go, but no, not this. Nothing would  ever be
    so egregious as this.
</p>
<p>
    <em>WEASLEYS!!!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Oh, how he hated them!
</p>
<p>
    Their scheming, and their plotting, and their useless  tricks and trinkets!
    And all of it, <em>all of it</em>, unleased upon him for no  better reason
    than to have a laugh at his expensive. Severus ground his teeth  so
    forcefully his jaw ached and his head began to throb.
    <em>
        Another migraine.  Splendid.
    </em>
    Those impertinent brats would pay for that as well.
</p>
<p>
    Severus would kill them this time, regardless of the lack  of evidence. For
    there never was any, no. Those dratted Twins always managed to  hide their
    trail from him. And every instance which he brought before Albus was
    readily dismissed with the same blasé excuse. For how could the
    <em>
        impartial
    </em>
    Headmaster sack them without good cause?
</p>
<p>
    His stride lengthened impatiently; his ire exacerbated  further with each
    ruminated thought over those childish fools. In that moment  he wanted
    nothing more than to hunt them down, make them beg for mercy as he  held
    them at wand-point, their pitiful pleas falling on deaf ears. But he
    couldn’t, not yet anyway. The monthly, <em>mandatory</em>, teachers’ meeting
    was  being held in the Staffroom at this very moment. A meeting which he was
    already  late for, his tardiness due to the Weasleys’ most recent
    <em>
        prank
    </em>
    .
</p>
<p>
    Of course, if those little shits were present at said  meeting, Severus
    could perhaps <em>kill</em> two birds with one stone. Yes. That  would be a
    grand thing indeed, storming through the door and dropping them both  where
    they stood, a look of utter shock and misery marred across their pale
    features.  Azkaban would be worth that.
</p>
<p>
    And all his fellow staff members would be staring at him,  disbelief etched
    into their faces. Their faith in him- or rather, the Word of  Dumbledore
    that extracted such faith from them- would evaporate, and they would  be
    forced to recognize the true monster that he was. Not that he wanted to
    terrify any of his colleagues, of course. Well, perhaps Trelawny. She
    irritated  the fuck out of him even on a good day.
</p>
<p>
    Severus cringed with the sudden realization that he was  about to enter a
    room full of people in his current state of distress. The  sparkles… How
    would he even begin to explain that? He groaned at the thought of  their
    persistent ogling. Oh, why must he be forced to attend these blasted
    meetings?!
</p>
<p><em>Fucking interfering Ministry!</em></p>
<p>
    There was nothing for it, he’d need to be there, or Albus  would ‘have words
    with him’ later, and that damned, reprimanding stare would  get under his
    skin worse than the vile pong he’d been exposed to.
</p>
<p>
    Oh, how pleasing <em>that</em> had been to discover.
</p>
<p>
    The smell. The smell. The smell. The smell! THE WRETCHED,  AWFUL STENCH OF
    IT!!! He’d cursed his highly attuned senses in that moment,  his body
    reeling from the effluvium more toxic than many a botched students’  potion.
</p>
<p><em>No. Calm yourself. You cannot let them see you so disturbed.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Through a great deal of effort, Severus made one final attempt to quell his
    anger, but it did him no good. No matter how much he tried to Occlude, the image
    of those ginger fools prevailed in his mind, their broad grins and raucous
    laughter blinding him with rage all over again.
</p>
<p>With murderous thoughts he
    continued his wrathful stride towards his destination, magic radiating outward with
    each pounding step.
</p>
<p>And the dregs of his sanity chose that moment to recall once
    more how this whole incident began only two short days ago…
</p>

<p class="chapterTitle">Friday</p>
<img class="pageBreak" src="../images/HP_Page%20Break_Transparent_Large_Purple.png">

<p>
    Friday morning had been the  usual,
    aggravating affair. Children stupidly milling about when they should  have
    been readying themselves for class and finishing their breakfast. Their
    constant, mirthful susurrus and occasional shrieks of glee over the
    approaching  Hogsmeade weekend only intensifying the cacophony.
</p>
<p>
    Severus avoided the brats as best he could, using secret  passageways and
    other go-betweens to reach the staff entrance to the Great  Hall, though
    little good it did him. As he rounded the corner of the reserved
    antechamber, those damnable, ginger-haired fools had approached the door to
    the  dais from the opposite direction. They were in high spirits as usual,
    chatting  animatedly about merlin-knew-what. It was bound to be something
    that would irritate  Severus to no end. He clenched his jaw, preparing for
    the onslaught of unavoidable  banter they would spew at him.
</p>
<p>
    “Morning, Severus!” The twins addressed him in unison.
</p>
<p>
    Their cheerful disposition forced a sneer to break out on  his face before
    he could stop it. This was followed closely by the nearly overwhelming  urge
    to throttle the pair of them. But no, that would not do. Albus did not
    tolerate infighting amongst the staff and if Severus dared to manhandle his
    <em>precious</em> Gryffindor’s…
</p>
<p>
    He still couldn’t believe they were colleagues. Nearly  two whole years
    spent suffering the eternal fools and their hellish torment  without end.
    The fact that they were now considered equals, that he no longer  held any
    power over them- not that the threat of detentions and loss of House  points
    ever did fuck-all to sway them- was sickening.
</p>
<p>
    That had been the crux of it for Severus. The double  employment of the
    Weasley Twins- or Twits, as he often referred to them in his  own head- to
    Hogwarts within the same year, and in fact, the same bloody job!
</p>
<p>
    It had all been part of Albus’ latest scheme to break the  DADA jinx for
    good.
</p>
<p>
    With the death of Voldemort in May of ‘98, it was  believed that there would
    no longer be a curse upon the school. But Albus was  taking no chances. He
    knew what Riddle was capable of, knew that he, like many  other dark wizards
    before him, could leave behind residual magic for centuries.  So, he put
    Minerva in charge of the Reconstruction of Hogwarts that summer and  locked
    himself away in his tall Tower.
</p>
<p>
    The old goat spent much of his spare time throughout the  school year
    devoted to removing the terrible stain upon Hogwarts'  reputation. The
    students were none the wiser, except perhaps those who caught  him wandering
    through the halls on a good day. There was a visible change to  the aged
    Headmaster, and it left an uncanny feeling in the pits of their  stomachs.
    They knew of his reputation for humming merrily, but never before  with such
    enthusiasm. And his eyes, how they twinkled. By the following summer  term,
    they practically glowed with intrigue.
</p>
<p>
    Severus knew the man must have finally cracked it the day  he heard Albus
    laughing hysterically out in the Quad. The sound reverberated  throughout
    the courtyards and even into the Great Hall where many staff and  students
    were congregated for lunch. Albus stood there, doubled over  with
    mirth, for nearly five minutes before steadying himself against the
    cloister wall and putting a hand to his forehead.
</p>
<p>
    And so, after many long hours of searching- and many more  withering hours
    spent relaying every single excruciating detail of information  to Severus-
    Albus had divulged, in full, his triumphant discovery.
</p>
<p>
    In short, the best way to break the curse was by  employing
    <em>
        multiple
    </em>
    people in the same position, at the same time. Then,  technically, there
    would be no <em>one</em> affected by it.
</p>
<p>
    That had always been one of the Dark Lord’s blind spots.  Simplicity. He’d
    spent decades perfecting his craft, honing his skills to  unparalleled
    levels, never once imagining anyone would be strong enough to get  the
    better of him. He’d woven spell after spell together, intrinsically
    fortifying them with deep and ancient magic, things even the wisest of
    people  never knew existed. The Dark Lord thought he was <em>so clever</em>
    in that  moment when Albus had denied him the job and he’d snuck through the
    school unleashing  Words of Power against anyone who dared to usurp what he
    so eagerly craved.
</p>
<p>
    And it was all pulled apart by a tiny bit of logic…
</p>
<p>
    Severus hated to admit it, but he was grateful to the  Headmaster. For now,
    surely, he would become the Defense instructor without hesitance.  He
    deserved the position after everything he’d sacrificed in the name of The
    Greater Good. It was his right! No one could deny him that!
</p>
<p>
    Oh, how stupid he had been.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, Albus would give it to someone else. Why waste  time and effort
    shuffling Severus about, when he was still perfectly suited as  the Potions
    Master? Hadn’t he been told many times over how <em>brilliant</em> he  was?
    That no one compared to his level of expertise? That Severus was, in fact,
    one of the best Potions Masters in the world? If Albus had praised him any
    further, he would have choked on it.
</p>
<p>
    Two decades…
</p>
<p>
    Two, very long, insufferable decades spent practically  begging the old man
    for the job with nothing more to show for it that a  pity-laced,
    <em>
        temporary
    </em>
    appointment just before The Final Battle…
</p>
<p>
    He’d beseeched Albus once again, desperate for him to see  reason this time.
    He didn’t need a pay rise. He didn’t need better quarters. He  only needed
    the one thing that would make his unending torment bearable. Severus  even
    went so far as to align himself with whomever the old man felt adequate to
    be his Defense partner. Hell, he’d take Lockhart-
</p>
<p>
    Albus had stared at him then, that knowing look in his  eyes.
</p>
<p>
    No. Not Lockhart. Severus had never been more than a  hair’s breadth away
    from killing the infuriating charlatan the last time they  were forced to
    work together. Not that it mattered now, since the idiot was  stuck in St
    Mungo’s with no real hope of ever getting out again. That at least  gave
    Severus a small amount of satisfaction, calming him enough to hear the  rest
    of whatever the Headmaster had to say.
</p>
<p>
    Albus continued, explaining how the Board of Governors, urged  by a strongly
    worded letter from the Wizengamot- in which he, the Chief Warlock, had not been
    consulted- had decided to evaluate each  member of
    the staff to determine their current and future standing within the  school.
    In other words, keep an eye on Severus to make sure he wasn’t still an ‘Evil
    Death Eater’, and report to them the moment he was found in breach of his
    contract. Albus was not pleased. He’d ‘cautioned’ the Governors against such
    involvement with the Ministry, knowing full well just how interfering they
    could be.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        As if you’ve never pulled anyone’s strings before,  you manipulative old
        bastard.
    </em>
    Severus couldn’t help but  grind his teeth.
</p>
<p>
    The Headmaster pushed on, ignoring the obvious tension  radiating outward
    from his former spy. He spoke of the various meetings with  the new
    chairman, the Board’s refusal to make concessions, and the subsequent
    injunction that he could not refute.
</p>
<p>
    Severus struggled to control his breathing, slight  tremors breaking out
    across his body as he braced himself for the worst of it.
</p>
<p>
    In the end, Albus told him that he had been forced to  concur with the
    Board, for they held the power to do as they pleased with his  school. And
    rather than stir up a doxy’s nest within the Ministry, it would be  better
    for everyone involved if Severus simply remained at his station.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Bloody fucking parchment pushing cunts!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Albus gave him a hard stare, knowing exactly what kind of  murderous
    thoughts were racing through his head and wanting to quell them  before he
    could set out to do something Unforgivable. Severus <em>hated</em> that
    look. He stormed the expanse of the Headmaster’s office, growling his
    frustrations into the far wall. Several of the eavesdropping portraits
    shrieked,  a few fell off their chairs, and Phineas sniggered at him.
</p>
<p>
    Severus turned sharply about, shutting out the  remonstrative babble of the
    former Headmasters as he glared daggers at Albus. The  old man simply
    gestured towards the chair before him, silently imploring  Severus to take
    his seat so they might finish their conversation. He even had  the gall to
    proffer him a damned sherbet lemon as he did so.
</p>
<p>
    Albus ignored Severus’ temper yet again, instead focusing  on the
    appointment of the new DADA professors. He felt, with the recent War and
    darkness that had permeated their world, that it was necessary to secure the
    position by employing Order members. Severus pointed out that <em>he</em>
    was an  Order member, but Albus had apparently gone deaf in that moment. And
    just as  Severus was about to berate him for his hypocrisy, the old codger
    changed  tactics and began regaling him with the preparations for the
    Millenium Ball!
</p>
<p>
    <em>How the fuck does that have anything to do  with this?!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Albus further ignored his agitated state, going on and on  about the blasted
    baubles and balloons and streamers and fairy lights and  fireworks-
</p>
<p>
    <em>Fireworks?</em>
</p>
<p>
    Yes. And not just any old fireworks. It was the Millenium  after all, and
    the school would play host to hundreds of students and their  visiting
    families eager to celebrate this once-in-a-lifetime occasion. Hogwarts
    needed something special, something grand. Oh, the Headmaster had such a
    devilish  twinkle in his eye.
</p>
<p>
    <em>That look bears nothing but trouble.</em>
</p>
<p>
    How fortunate it was then, for Albus to have a connection  with two of the
    brightest explosives experts to come out of Hogwarts in recent years.
</p>
<p>
    <em>He couldn’t mean…</em>
</p>
<p>
    The young people called them Legends, their Wildfire  Whizz-Bangs surpassing
    even the great Dr. Filibuster’s many aerial achievements.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Not them.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Severus sat there, half-numb with cold realization,  listening to the
    doddering old fool recount his delightful tale of how the very  same day
    that he should discover a solution to the curse, he’d also taken  afternoon
    tea with the Twits.
</p>
<p>
    <em>No.</em>
</p>
<p>
    They’d come to the castle, hoping to entice the decrepit  old loon into
    buying products from that reprehensible shop of theirs for the
    much-anticipated Ball. And Albus, realizing the double opportunity set
    before  him, pounced on it immediately.
</p>
<p>
    <em>He wouldn’t dare!</em>
</p>
<p>
    The Twits were quite flattered by the proposal, and it took  surprisingly
    little to convince them to join his staff at Hogwarts.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Fuck!!!</em>
</p>
<p>
    And Albus- that ever-present, nauseatingly mirthful twinkle  in his eyes-
    had their contracts signed, sealed, and filed away before supper.  Their
    employment would be announced publicly the following day.
</p>
<p>
    <em>ARGH!!!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Albus sat there calm as ever, his hands neatly folded  together before him,
    a mischievous glint behind those half-moon specs. It gave Severus  pause,
    and he wondered for the millionth time if this latest debacle wasn’t just
    another one of his many <em>schemes</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Severus pinched the bridge of his nose and Albus offered  him a pain potion.
    He’d refused, taking his leave in a dejected huff, barely  registering the
    honest apology flung at his back as he hastened through the  door. He had to
    get out of there before he blew something up.
</p>
<p>
    He’d taken the spiraled stairs two at a time, fighting  for composure with
    each bounding step. It was a long walk back to the dungeons,  but not long
    enough to sufficiently vent his anger, and Severus was in danger  of hexing
    the first person he saw if he did not release it soon. He’d decided then  to
    take the newly created secret passageway at the base of the tower, to the
    left of the gargoyles, just beyond the portrait of Agnes Sampson. It would
    lead him straight to the Fobbiden Forest, a place where he could certainly
    let  off some steam.
</p>
<p>
    The walk had done him good. By the time he’d returned-  with an apology to
    Bane for his egregious outburst along the way- Severus had  convinced
    himself that the events of the day were not so bad after all. Surely,
    Albus’ plan would fail, and everyone would see how pointless it was to
    employee  those dunderheaded ginger imps. It would not work. It
    <em>
        could
    </em>
    not work.  Severus would merely need to withstand their idiocy for a year
    until they met their  unpleasant fate, then, <em>then</em> the job would
    finally be his. And no amount  of jinxing or hexing or cursing of any kind
    would tear him away from his  position! The Dark Lord and The Ministry be
    damned to all of Hades!!!
</p>
<p>
    But it <em>had</em> worked. They’d done it. The curse was broken,  and the
    Weasley Twits became the victors in the war on DADA professors for good.
    And not only had they survived their first year, but they’d also proven
    their  competency beyond the shadow of a doubt. They were well loved by
    staff and  students alike, the only inhabitants of the castle to openly
    criticize or  condemn them being Filch and his mangy cat. Severus knew he
    would never get rid  of them now.
</p>
<p>
    The very worst of it though, had been their unwavering  jovial attitudes.
    Oh, how it infuriated him! Knowing they fared so well under  the constant
    pressures of tutelage, always offering a smile, eager to encourage  the
    little dimwitted brats under their care. No detentions- not even for the
    Slytherins- and rarely ever a House point lost to anyone!
</p>
<p>
    Of course, why would the fools need to reprimand those  idiot children when
    they were never disobedient in the first place? Always  hanging on every
    word and completing each assignment swiftly and accurately in  the hopes
    that the ‘Cool Duo’ with grace them with another of their <em>amazing</em>
    products.
</p>
<p>
    Yes, Severus knew all about that little side hustle of  theirs, the Twits
    pretending their ‘rewards for good behaviour’ nonsense was  anything other
    than a means to add traffic to their horrid little shop. He’d  brought this
    up with Albus, who once again brushed aside their antics with the  wave of
    his hand. Weasley products weren’t illegal after all, and he couldn’t  just
    sack them based on Severus’ deductions. The old man even dismissed Filch
    when he puffed and wheezed that he’d caught students using ‘those Weasley
    pranks’ on several occasions. And once again it was for the lack of
    evidence.
</p>
<p>
    The Twits, Severus hated to admit, were very clever  indeed. They had
    somehow managed to charm their products into <em>dissolving</em>,  for lack
    of a better word, whenever a member of the faculty confiscated them. Not
    that anyone other than Filch ever got hold of their stuff. The brats knew
    better than to let a teacher catch them out.
</p>
<p>
    And so, Severus was left with his age-old punishments as  a means to balance
    the scales. No one dared to incur his wrath, but he still  gave out plenty
    of detentions and deducted lots of House points. A small  comfort, but
    better than nothing.
</p>
<p>
    His only other solace was to shut himself away in the  Dungeons where the
    imps rarely ever visited. They were cold, clammy, and  contemptable, but
    very much a welcomed respite from the insufferable pair.
</p>
<p>
    He spent every spare minute of his time sequestered in  his personal
    quarters or in his private lab. There were always potions to brew  and
    experiment with, or publications to catch up on.
</p>
<p>But Severus was never so lucky as to become a true hermit.</p>
<p>
    Albus had implemented a new rule upon the reopening of  Hogwarts in the
    autumn of ‘98, a rule stating quite clearly that all staff  members must
    appear for at least one meal of the day together. And so, he was  forced
    into the tempest of falderal that was breakfast.
</p>
<p>
    Morning People.
</p>
<p>
    Severus was <em>not</em> a morning person, he never had  been, even though
    he rose at precisely six o’clock every day. Years upon years  of repetitive
    preparations for teaching as well as his <em>duties</em> to two  Masters
    kept him on this rigorous schedule, and now, at the age of forty-one,  it
    seemed pointless to change his habits. If anyone cared to remember his
    childhood though- not the detrimental home life where he was beaten by his
    father for even suggesting a lie in, but his blissful escape to Hogwarts for
    ten months out of the year- they would recall how little time Severus
    actually  spent in the Great Hall during breakfast.
</p>
<p>
    He had everything down to an exact art by his twelfth  birthday. Seal and
    silence the curtains around his bed. Set his alarm for twenty  past eight.
    Rise, dress, and depart with just enough time to grab a bite and  walk with
    Lily to their morning class. The fact that this granted him a  temporary
    avoidance of those hounding Marauders was pure coincidence.
</p>
<p>
    This was his morning routine throughout most of Severus’  schooling. There
    was always the chance of upheaval due to those relentless,  pranking
    bastards, and gradually there grew a noticeable distance between  himself
    and Lily, but it was still manageable in the end.
    <em>
        Until O.W.L.s,  when you lost her forever…
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Then his final year arrived, and with it the pressure to appear  worthy of
    recruitment into the ranks of the Dark Lord. Severus was no longer  afforded
    the luxury of a lie in. Every moment that he wasn’t studying for his
    N.E.W.T.s was spent in the company of his fellow conspirators and eventual
    Brothers…
</p>
<p>
    And then the moment came when everything fell apart  entirely, and Severus
    knew not what time of day it was, nor did he care. Numb  with shock at what
    he’d done. Terrorized by fear of what would happen next…
</p>
<p>
    But he was saved! <em>She</em> would be spared; <em>they</em> would be safe!
    Severus’ conscription as a spy and teacher was a small price to  pay for the
    only thing that mattered to him in his miserable life…
</p>
<p>
    When Lily di-
</p>
<p>
    …
</p>
<p>
    …
</p>
<p>
    When it happened… Severus wished day and night that it  had been his own
    fate. He’d fantasized unendingly about how to go about it,  throughout
    mealtimes, and classes, and marking, and meetings. In his sleep! Oh,  those
    were the worst moments of his wretched existence! For <em>she</em> was
    always there. She was always there, and no matter how many nights he spent
    slashing his wrists or throwing himself into the lake, <em>she</em> would be
    <em>right  there</em> to bring him back, to remind him of his promise…
</p>
<p>
    Severus hated sleeping. There were ways to circumvent  that of course, but
    it was only temporary, and accumulatively unhealthy. In the  end, he was
    forced to rest his eyes for at least several hours before dawn.  Then,
    <em>
        then
    </em>
    he could indulge in his coffee, a habit he’d never fully  realized until he
    became a member of the staff.
</p>
<p>
    And in twenty years’ time, even with the defeat of the  Dark Lord and the
    blissful absence of one, Harry
    ‘The-strutting-Fool-Who-Lived-To-Annoy-Me-Twice’ Potter, Severus had not
    changed this practice.
</p>
<p>
    Severus needed three very strong coffees each morning  just to take the edge
    off his duties. The chittering and chattering of those  repugnant children
    with their carefree lives… Well, most of them, anyway. The  older students
    were still wary, still unusually quiet. A lingering bit of  turmoil in their
    eyes. They remembered all too well those final days before the  Battle. But
    even they could laugh occasionally.
</p>
<p>
    Severus could not.
</p>
<p>
    The nightmares…
</p>
<p>They weren’t constant anymore, only  several times a week,
    but the thoughts surrounding the last two horrible  decades of his life
    infiltrated even his most benign dreams and forced Severus  to relive them
    every day. He could only Occlude so much…</p>
<p>
    There had been exactly three nights since the end of the War  in which he’d
    slept peacefully, and each of those were spent in the company of  others.
</p>
<p>
    The company in question- a rather flirtatious couple  looking for a ‘fling’-
    was only a recent development in his life, and Thursday  evening had been
    their third encounter. The first one Severus had written off entirely as a
    blessed fluke, and the second one, well… that just didn’t count, but this time-
</p>
<p>
    Was a mistake.
</p>
<p>
    He was foolish.
</p>
<p>
    It was wrong.
</p>
<p>
    He hadn’t wanted it…
</p>
<p>
    That’s what Severus told himself, anyway…
</p>
<p>
    He’d spent the night, the <em>whole</em> night, having  fallen asleep
    nestled between the pair of them in a heap of sweaty, tangled  limbs.
    Severus had never stayed with anyone. He’d come close to it with their
    first encounter, but through his diminishing postcoital haze he’d managed to
    extract himself, silently dressing, with barely a word spoken before
    departing.
</p>
<p>
    Thankfully, his internal clock had woken him in its usual  manner. Severus
    dreaded the complications that would have arisen within the  school if he’d
    not been punctual on his return. The questions… Albus would have  figured it
    out. He could not let that happen. No one could ever know.
</p>
<p>
    As Severus apparated before the gates of Hogwarts, he ruminated  on the
    tryst and how he’d left the sleepy couple just before dawn. The awkward
    silence, those hesitant yet hope-filled words… No. No, that would never do.
    He  couldn’t allow this ‘fling’ to become habitual. Severus had merely
    needed a  distraction from the upcoming Easter break and all its end of term
    nonsense.
</p>
<p>There  was nothing more to be said on the matter.</p>
<p>He was done with them.</p>
<p>Forever!</p>
<p>
    This mantra reverberated like a busy, buzzing hive inside  his head,
    following him all the way back to the castle and into his private quarters.
    Severus did his best to ignore the entire ordeal and prepare for the day,
    but  the quiet left him vulnerable to memories of that night
    once  more.
</p>
<p>
    He cringed at the thought of their exchange before he  left. He’d been far
    too receptive, too revealing in his desperation for  respite. He’d said
    things. Things a man like Severus Snape should never utter  to anyone alive.
    He was not the sentimental type. He was not sweet and light.  He was not
    cuddly nor wistful nor quaint, nor any other term of endearment that  so
    many would bandy about with pride. Severus was mean, cruel, vicious even. He
    spent his days fuming and berating incompetent children. He spent his nights
    in  solitude, with nothing more than the scratch of his quill butchering
    their  dunderheaded essays, and the occasional bubble of potions or crackle
    of burning  wood for ambience.
</p>
<p>
    That was how those Twits found him Friday morning,  anxious from his
    encounter the night before. Replaying those ridiculous words  over and over
    again in his mind. <em>‘You don’t have to leave.’</em> the kind one
    pleaded. <em>‘I wish I could stay.’</em> Severus had responded. The words
    were  out of his mouth before he could think, and by the time he’d realized
    just what  he’d meant by them, it was too late. But Severus did manage to
    catch himself  before his panic took hold. Two decades as a spy had kept him
    sharp enough for  that at least.
</p>
<p>
    He’d fled back to the safety of his Dungeons on the flimsy  excuse of
    responsibility to the school. A cold shower with biting soap was  called for
    then, followed by his most severe robes, 52 buttons in all.  Impeccable as
    ever, he strode to the ill-awaited summons of his daily  conscripted meal.
    And every corridor those words played over in his mind. Every  stride a
    reminder of his aching, disused muscles, and the pleasurable  consequences
    of his actions.
</p>
<p>
    Why did he say those things? None of it was true. Their  entanglement had
    merely been a distraction from his constant anguish, nothing  more. It could
    never be more. He didn’t want more. Why, oh why, did he say it,  then?! <em>
    [Because you wanted to…]</em> the haunting little voice in the back of  his
    head whispered.
</p>
<p>
    Severus needed to put those miserable thoughts out of his  mind. He would be
    due to teach in an hour and the third year Hufflepuffs were  beyond abysmal.
    Severus forced himself to focus on the awaiting salvation that  was his
    morning coffee. The whisps of steam, the rich aroma, the fierce, dark
    liquid coursing through his veins…
</p>
<p>
    And that’s when he spotted the Twits. That stupid,  cheerful tone. The
    ever-present mischief in their eyes. He couldn’t help but  sneer, struggling
    to suppress a snarl in the wake of their chipper
    <em>‘Morning,  Severus!’</em>. Oh, how he would have loved to hex them into the following  millennium.
    Instead, he simply carried on and continued towards the chamber  door, not
    bothering with any imposed pleasantries.
</p>
<p>
    “What a way to begin your morning, Gred.”
</p>
<p>
    “Nearly enough to put you off your breakfast, Forge.”
</p>
<p>
    “What do you think has our illustrious Potions Master in  such a snit?”
</p>
<p>
    “Perhaps, he’s been couped up in the Dungeons for too  long?”
</p>
<p>
    “That could very well be it, brother mine.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus continued to ignore them as he reached for the  door handle, their
    chatter like the buzzing of gnats to his ears.
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, don’t be so gloomy, Severus. It’s a wonderful day.”
</p>
<p>
    “The sun is shining.”
</p>
<p>
    “The birds are singing.”
</p>
<p>
    “Flowers are in bloom!” They chimed together.
</p>
<p>
    That was too much for Severus. He turned sharply; his jaw  clenched to the
    point of breaking as he growled, “What could possibly be so  wonderous about
    the cyclicity of nature and all its abhorrent detritus?!” He  grasped his
    wand and nearly pulled it from his sleeve when Albus approached  them from
    the adjacent hall.
</p>
<p>
    “Good morning, professors. What a pleasure it is to see  you three together.
    Conferring about your Hogsmeade duties tomorrow, no doubt.  Well, fear not,
    Severus. Aurora has fully recovered from her bout with Dragon  Pox and has
    agreed to resume her post.”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, what a shame!” Fred exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
    “We wanted to show Severus the Shrivelfig buds and the  Wandering Crab Apple
    blossoms on our way to the village.” George pouted.
</p>
<p>
    Albus chuckled heartily. “Ah, yes. Spring has sprung in  the Highlands and
    it’s a glorious day!” The old man practically skipped with  whimsy as he
    wandered past them through the door and took his place at the High  Table.
</p>
<p>
    Severus glared menacingly at the Twits, then swiftly  vanished through the
    door, shutting out their guffaws. He took his usual seat  beyond Albus and
    sank into his chair, silently fuming with well-practiced  obstinance.
</p>
<p>
    Most of his colleagues gave him a wide berth that  morning, although he was
    forced to acknowledge Bathsheda when she asked for the  treacle. He quickly
    passed the jar, slamming it down harder than was  appropriate in the company
    of children. They all knew how much he hated the  cloying stuff. Why the
    bloody hell would the damned woman ask him for it rather  than just reach
    across him to retrieve it herself? It wasn’t as if he had any  personal
    space with which others might be concerned, granting him even a sliver  of
    respect as a human being!
</p>
<p>
    But it didn’t end there, no. The Ancient Runes professor  decided to add
    salt to the wound by thanking him for his kindness. And then she  had the
    audacity to banter with him! Her incessant voice hammering in his skull
    like the fucking plague!
</p>
<p>
    It seemed to go on for hours but couldn’t have been more  than several
    minutes before Severus lost it completely. He whipped his head  towards her,
    his voice low enough so the brats wouldn’t hear him, “Stop  blathering, you
    idiot! Do us all a favour and shovel the rest of that porridge  into your
    mouth so we might find some solace in our own breakfasts!”
</p>
<p>
    Severus knew Albus was giving him one of his hard stares,  but he ignored
    the silent reprimand and returned to his runny eggs that were  already
    congealing on his plate. There would be another ‘talk’ that day, he was
    sure of it. Let the old man tear him down, what would one more mark against
    him  do to his tattered soul? Severus pushed his plate away and left the
    table, his  precious coffee untouched.
</p>
<p>He had the onslaught of students to prepare for.</p>
<p>
    Nothing further occurred that morning which would have  led Severus to
    suspect the Duo of any tomfoolery against him. Although, there had been a  lull in
    pranking for more than a month… Severus should have known  better.
    How could he, <em>a spy</em>, have let his guard down?! Oh, yes. The
    ‘fling’. Driving him to distraction with constant, vivid flashes of their
    sordid liaison.
</p>
<p>
    In all honesty, Severus had not suspected the Twits would  ever dare to
    cross him, especially now that they were adults and left without  custodial
    protection. That was, until the first of many little jokes were  flitted
    about. They were harmless, common, everyday sorts of pranks. Things  that
    irritated Severus but were utterly beneath his response. However, he was a
    tenured professor of one of the most prodigious wizarding schools in the
    world  and therefore deserved the respect of those little bastards. But no,
    Albus  believed them innocent of all crimes against him. His favourite
    little  Gryffindors…
</p>
<p>
    Maybe Severus was overreacting. Maybe those harmless little  jokes really
    were just a bunch of brats playing about in the halls, and it had  nothing
    to do with him whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
    Bollocks.
</p>
<p>
    Even if he never caught them, Severus <em>knew</em> those  Twits were
    responsible for all his hellish turmoil. And the refuge of his  Dungeons was
    the only thing that spared them from an Unforgivable. The only  thing that
    allowed him to focus well enough on the usual disgusting business of
    attempting to teach the unteachable Lilliputians in his charge.
</p>
<p>
    It was exhausting. Every last bit of it. Instructing and  berating, the
    lesson plans, the marking, the <em>utterly relentless</em> marking of
    worthless essays!<em> What neanderthal could possibly be so stupid as to
    confuse bees</em>WAX<em> for bee </em>BALM<em>?!</em>
</p>
<p>
    And nothing helped to counter it. Not even his nightly  rounds of the
    castle, in which Severus had the pleasure of deducting as many House points
    as he liked from the unfortunate students that crossed his path.
</p>
<p>
    His life had dissolved into a stagnant, torturous affair.  Something that
    even the Dark Lord, a creature without the ability to love,  would have
    pitied. A mercy killing, the serpentine man would have called it.  Better to
    do it quickly, no need for further suffering. Severus had been his <em>greatest</em>, <em>most devoted</em> follower
    after all. He deserved to die with at least a  modicum of dignity.
</p>
<p>
    His stomach lurched, caught between disgust and longing  at his deceased
    Master’s ability to obliterate him on the spot. And Severus  wished, not for
    the last time, that he had died during the Battle. Whether by  the Dark
    Lord’s hand or someone else mattered very little to him in the end.  Anyone
    that could remove him from his current situation would have been  welcomed
    to it.
</p>
<p>
    Anything… Anything at all. Just to get him away from this  infernal place!
</p>
<p>
    Severus <em>hated</em> it here. He hated the ceaseless  chatter of jubilant
    children. He hated the forced pleasantries with his colleagues. He hated sifting
    through the minutiae when Albus posed a loaded  question. He hated Peeves. He hated
    the Ghosts. He hated the sentience that was  present in every part of the castle,
    smothering him, <em>suffocating</em> him  with its centuries-old whispers of deep
    magic that he could never even hope to fathom.
</p>
<p>
    He hated the walls and how they taunted him night and day  with both
    security and insanity, desperately needing to leave but unable to  flee.  He
    hated his wretched Dungeon  quarters. He hated being Head of House. He hated
    their insipid colours, petty  rivalries, and blind loyalty! He hated
    Quiddich! He hated the sun for shining  and the earth for spinning! He hated
    all of it! Every fucking moment of it! He  shouldn’t be alive! He shouldn’t
    be <em>here</em>! He shouldn’t still be  teaching! He’d played his part; the
    War was over! He deserved his freedom!!!
</p>
<p>
    <em>BASTARDS!!!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Fuck the ministry! Fuck the Aurors!  Fuck all of them! Severus was through
    playing  their little games! He was not a child to be reprimanded for some
    delinquency!  He was a fully qualified wizard, a renowned Potions Master
    that had received  dozens of offers of employment! He would do whatever he
    damn well pleased!
</p>
<p>
    Severus forced himself to relax as he mulled over the  many options
    available to him. Iceland’s Askjan Bruggfélag had access to their very  own
    volcano in the Reykjanes Peninsula as well as some of the rarest potion
    ingredients  in the world. But Pociones Principios in Madrid was a major
    contender as the  Asociación had promised him nearly double his current
    salary- not that he cared for material wealth all that much, but it would
    afford him an unparalleled expense account for a top-notch lab. The American
    Institute for Alchemy was a respectable choice as well, although Severus doubted
    he’d  ever get used to such a garish place.
</p>
<p>
    Of course… there was always Fiji…
</p>
<p>
    Severus had fantasized many times about running off to  the South Pacific
    paradise. An uninhabited- for muggles anyway- island in the  Rotuma Group.
    The magical village of Tan hae Hefhefu. Warm, sandy beaches.  Kind,
    unquestioning people. Lots of ancient reefs full of colourful fish. A  place
    where he could set up his own apothecary and potions shop, surrounded by  a
    dense forest and nestled among the cliffs and grottos. Who wouldn’t want
    that?
</p>
<p>
    It was Severus’ dirty little secret.
</p>
<p>
    The collective wizarding populace of Britain would have been  stunned ridged
    if they’d known the big, bad Death Eater pined for something so  beautiful.
    Because how could he be human enough to want anything, to deserve  anything
    in his wretchedly miserable life? But he did. Severus wanted it so  badly he
    could taste it, the desperation burrowed deep within the marrow of his
    bones!
</p>
<p>
    He could do it. Pretend to blow himself up and be gone  before the dust had
    settled. An international portkey…. Unregistered… Child’s  play for someone
    as capable as Severus.
</p>
<p>
    No. Even secret portkeys left a trail if you knew how to  look for them.
    And those fucking cunts from the Department of Mysteries would be  all over him
    before his feet even hit the ground.
</p>
<p>
    Apparition was out of the question. Severus would need to  compress his
    traveling down into a single trip- nearly 16,000 kilometers- to  avoid the
    monitoring charm, and not even he could withstand such a significant  drain
    on his magic.
</p>
<p>
    Severus sighed deeply as he left his classroom for lunch and  headed to his
    quarters. The truth was, as much as he wanted to go through with  his plan,
    he hadn’t the strength for such a venture.
</p>
<p>
    His loneliness was crippling him.
</p>
<p>
    He didn’t want to admit it. He <em>couldn’t</em> admit it.  Not to something
    so… so primitive and debasing as <em>that</em>. It was ridiculous  for him
    to even consider the notion that he might <em>need</em> someone. Severus
    had never needed anyone before- <em>not since</em> <em>her</em>- so why
    start  now?  Relationships of any kind were  complicated and aggravating and
    utterly pointless if you wanted solitude and  independence. Which he did.
    Severus liked being alone. He <em>loved</em> it, in  fact. No one to bother
    him with their inane chitchat or maudlin behaviour. No  one hovering over
    him, constantly worrying about his state of mind or physical  wellbeing.
</p>
<p>
    But that horrible little voice inside his head was always  there…
</p>
<p>
    <em>Taunting</em> him with what could  have been…
</p>
<p>
    What still could be, if only Severus would give in, just this  once…
</p>
<p>
    Give in to all those things he’d convinced himself he  didn’t need and had
    resorted to thrice now with that mesmeric Couple. The stuff  he felt like
    engaging in at that very moment just to forget about his servitude  for a
    little while longer. It wouldn’t be so bad. He could tolerate them one  more
    time.
</p>
<p>
    It would be only too easy to contact them…
</p>
<p>
    <em>No.</em>
</p>
<p>
    But…
</p>
<p>
    They wanted him, the kind one said so. The idiot one just  grumbled, but
    couldn’t deny his attraction…
</p>
<p>
    <em>No.</em>
</p>
<p>
    But Severus could not deny his attraction either, and  found himself eagerly
    looking forward to their next chance meeting. Anticipating  the implied
    solicitation…
</p>
<p>
    This line of thought troubled Severus greatly. There was  something deeper
    than need driving him towards them. Something… something  desperate. That
    little voice intruded once more and began to whisper such  suggestive things
    to him
    <em>
        [You’ve become addicted to them… Their companionship,  the intimacy,
        your contentment… Perhaps, even lov-]
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>No! Never that!</em> Severus  had learned his lesson with
    <em>her</em> all those years ago. He would never, <em>ever</em> allow anyone
    to get that close to him again.
    <em>
        Put it out of your mind, put it  out of your mind, put it out of your
        mind…
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Severus had reached his chambers without realizing it. He  was simply
    standing before the threshold, staring at the door to the private  entrance
    of his quarters for who knew how long. Thank Merlin, he wasn’t in the  hall
    where those insufferable little mites could witness his discomfiture.
</p>
<p>
    He closed his eyes, forcing his Occlumency shields to  slam shut entirely.
    He needed to check on the potions in his private lab, and  any stray
    thoughts of <em>Them</em> could prove… disastrous. After that, Severus
    would allow himself a moment to take a light lunch with a copious amount of
    tea, or perhaps coffee- he still hadn’t had one, or three- before the next
    batch of dunderheads could irritate him.
</p>
<p>
    Severus unwarded the door, stepped through into his  sitting room, and froze
    when he witnessed the unthinkable.
</p>
<p>
    Flowers.
</p>
<p>
    Flowers everywhere.
</p>
<p>
    From the floor to the ceiling, in every nook and cranny,  even sticking out
    of the fucking fireplace! Large bunches, small bunches, bursting  with
    bright pops of colour in seemingly endless arrangements! A bloody fucking
    tempest of flowers!!! Their roots unseen but obviously tethered to whatever
    surface they touched. All spring-blooming by the look of them.
</p>
<p>
    Severus was so bewildered by this hideous display that he  remained frozen
    to the spot, gaping at what he could only hope was a  caffeine-deprived
    hallucination. Or perhaps he’d finally gone completely mad,  and this was
    the resulting manifestation. Either way, something was terribly  wrong with
    his sitting room.
</p>
<p>
    Wait, was it merely the living area, or did it extend to  his bedroom, the
    bathroom, the kitchenette? <em>Oh, Merlin! My lab!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Severus almost gave in to the maddening impulse to bolt  towards his
    precious potions, but his spy senses halted him in his tracks. He  had not
    survived these last twenty years acting like some brash Gryffindor
    brainlessly flying into the fray. Instead, Severus pulled back against the
    door  frame, his wand at the ready, and braced himself for an attack. He
    cast a silent <em>Revelio</em> on his surroundings.
</p>
<p>
    Nothing.
</p>
<p>
    Severus relaxed marginally. He hadn’t expected to find anyone  lurking in
    his quarters- no one was <em>that</em> stupid- but if his life as a double
    agent had taught him anything, it was that one could never be too careful.
</p>
<p>
    All of this passed in roughly fifteen seconds from the  time he’d discovered
    the invasive flora. And now that he’d verified that there  was no immediate
    threat of bodily harm, Severus could focus on the other  pressing matters at
    hand. Namely, whether or not the entirety of his quarters  was affected.
</p>
<p>
    Severus had never been more grateful in his life for the  ability to fly, as
    there was hardly any bare patch of floor with which to stand  upon. And he
    knew better than to allow his body to touch any foreign substance  without
    proper investigation first. Although he couldn't yet confirm that what he was
    seeing was entirely real, the smell was certainly convincing.
</p>
<p>
    He hovered towards the door to his bedroom, the  suffocating floral essence
    nearly overwhelming him as he went. A single bouquet  could be appreciated
    if Severus were so inclined, but there were hundreds,  possibly thousands of
    them to deal with in such a confined space. The sickening  scent permeated
    everything. Their perfume would aggravate his sinuses for days!
</p>
<p>
    Severus cast silently once more, the door to his bedroom  magically opening
    to reveal its usual pristine state. Several more spells to  determine if
    anything suspicious were present turned up nothing, and he moved  on to the
    other rooms. The rest of his chambers appeared to be untouched.
</p>
<p>
    Only his sitting room seemed to be affected. The question  now was
    <em>
        why?
    </em>
    And how did this occur in the first place? Severus was well  aware of the
    castle’s ability to ‘change’ at times. Over the centuries there  had been
    several notable events added to Hogwarts: A History, although none of  those
    instances had ever involved flowers.
</p>
<p>
    Severus landed in the middle of the room, the largest  bare patch of floor
    and wide enough for both his feet. He silently studied a  small bunch of
    daffodils in front of him. They looked like flowers, but he was  taking no
    chances. He cast several more in-depth spells. Nothing spurious.
</p>
<p>
    Severus reached down and gently brushed his forefinger  across a petal. It
    certainly felt like a flower. He hesitatingly grasped the  bunch and pulled
    upward. They were firmly embedded in the floor, the roots were  nowhere
    visible but whether that was due to their non-existence or simply being
    fastened below the stone slabs, Severus had no idea. He grasped the stems
    more  tightly and gave them a quick twist. The bunch tore neatly near the
    base,  little tufts of green left in their wake.
</p>
<p>
    He brought them before his nose and sniffed carefully.  They were flowers.
    Just flowers. Severus furrowed his brow and dropped them  back to the floor,
    but even as he did so they began to slowly… <em>dissolve</em>.
</p>
<p>
    A fiery chill swept through his body. The sudden  realization barreling into
    him like a stampeding Erumpent.
</p>
<p>
    <em>WEASLEYS!!!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Those damnable fools!!! They had done this to him! No one  else would ever
    dare to be so, so… Severus didn’t even have words to describe  the depths
    with which they had plunged to molest him this time!
</p>
<p>
    They had breeched his wards, broken into his quarters! Violated  his sitting
    room with a Royal Gardens-worth of fucking flowers!!!
</p>
<p>
    But how…
</p>
<p>
    The Floo!
</p>
<p>
    It was the only access point available to all staff  members. But Severus
    <em>always</em> kept his warder shut against the others. No  one could get
    through, absolutely <em>no one</em>. Unless he gave them express  permission
    to invade his space. And Severus would <em>never</em> let <em>them</em> in.
    Somehow… they’d managed it all on their own. Oh, the audacity of those
    ginger Twits!
</p>
<p>That was it!</p>
<p><em>The very. Last. STRAW!!!</em></p>
<p>
    Severus finally gave way to the torrent of magic flowing  through him. It
    exploded outward in a singular deadly wave, disintegrating every bunch and
    obliterating each petal, banishing them back into the stars of creation from whence they came. His
    breathing was harsh, and his fists shook at his sides. The rage was so powerful
    within him! But Severus the Spy was a man of great control, and he willed
    himself into a manageable state before he could risk further destruction of
    his quarters. Meditating on the quiet that surrounded him, he took a final,
    deep breath and released it slowly as the room returned to its normal state
    once more.
</p>
<p>
    Or did it?
</p>
<p>
    There was a lingering odor present. It was light but not  delicate, similar
    to oranges or lemons. What some might call the essence of  Spring itself.
    Almost like- yes! Primrose.
</p>
<p>
    Severus scanned the room carefully, hunting for the  offensive remnant that
    his ire had not seen fit to do away with earlier. There  was nothing out of
    place, at least from what he could espy from that position.  He walked the
    length of the sitting room then, but still there was nothing. He  checked
    each room in turn and they were all devoid of anything but the strong
    scent.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Where is it?</em>
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps it was merely the imprint left in his nostrils  then? Severus cast a
    cleansing spell to clear his sinuses and breathed deeply.  The overwhelming
    odor was still there. He doubled checked his surroundings  again for any
    visible sign of foliage. He saw nothing, but the cloying scent was  present
    no matter where he stepped, like it was bloody well following him  around
    the room!
</p>
<p>
    <em>No…</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>No, it can’t be.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Severus brought his hand before his face, staring at his  trembling fingers,
    hardly daring to breathe and knowing that he must go through  with it.
    Slowly, hoping beyond hope that his hunch was wrong, he brought his  hand
    closer still and sniffed.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Gah!</em>
</p>
<p>
    It was him! He was the thing that smelled!
</p>
<p>
    Never in all his years- not even when he had Longbottom  under his tutelage,
    with the promise of an exploded potion enveloping him on  any given day- had
    Severus Snape ever smelled like fucking <em>flowers!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Severus growled, his shaking hand before him balled into  a tight fist. He
    would add this latest slight against him to the ever-growing  list committed
    by the Twits. But first, he needed to diminish the abominable  odor on his
    skin. He swished his wand through the air, a silent spell in his  thoughts.
</p>
<p>
    And nothing happened.
</p>
<p>
    He tried again, carefully enunciating the words and  steadying his hand for
    each required flourish.
</p>
<p>
    The smell remained.
</p>
<p>
    Severus tried again, this time casting every spell he  knew might be
    effective.
</p>
<p>
    But the primrose prevailed.
</p>
<p>
    <em>No!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Oh, those little bastards! He would get them for this.  Nothing less than
    torture was called for this time. He was going to eviscerate  them-
    <em>
        slowly
    </em>
    - and with a spoon if he could manage it.
</p>
<p>
    Severus raged outward and onward from his rooms,  forgetting all about his
    potions and his lunch, as he stormed towards the First  Floor where the
    Weasleys resided. With each step that carried him closer to his  destination
    the madness grew stronger. He fumed. He huffed. He felt the  tendrils of
    fire trailing after him in his wake. He was so close, so close now.  Nothing
    would stop him from-
</p>
<p>
    Albus rounded the corner just in front of him, forcing  Severus to abruptly
    halt his steps. He quickly schooled his features but felt  certain the wise
    Headmaster had seen his ire. Sure enough, Albus reached out a  gentle, yet
    firm hand and placed it on his shoulder. “Severus? Is anything the  matter?”
</p>
<p>
    “No.” Severus snipped, unable to control himself as well  as he’d have
    liked. That calculating glint was piercing him through.
</p>
<p>
    “Are you sure? You seem rather upset about something.”
</p>
<p>
    “I’m fine.” Severus barely managed through gritted teeth.
</p>
<p>
    “Well, in that case…” Albus steered him towards the  landing leading down to
    the Ground Floor. “Join me for a cup of cocoa in the Kitchens,  won’t you?”
</p>
<p>
    “I’m rather busy at the moment.” Severus felt the blood  in his veins racing
    like molten lead.
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, you have time for a cocoa, my boy. Your next class  isn’t until one.”
    Albus chided as they waited patiently for the staircase to  return.
</p>
<p>
    “I was in the middle of something… <em>personal</em>.”  Severus spat.
</p>
<p>
    “Ah. I thought you might be. And from the look of things,  I’d say that this
    has something to do with Fred and George Weasley, hmm?” Albus  gave him
    another piercing stare as they descended to the Ground Floor and  headed towards
    the Kitchen Corridor of the Basement.
</p>
<p>
    Severus knew he was in dangerous territory. “What makes  you think this has
    anything to do with them?”
</p>
<p>
    “Well, you are rather cross-looking at the moment, and no  one seems to get
    under your skin the way they do, so who else would it be?”
</p>
<p>
    Severus opened his mouth to deny any such thing when the  barmy old codger
    spoke again.
</p>
<p>
    “And I already know about the little prank they pulled on  you.” He tickled
    the pear outside the hidden entrance to the Kitchens.
</p>
<p>
    Severus was taken aback. “H-how?”
</p>
<p>
    “Your quarters were not the only ones affected.” Albus  replied as he
    stepped beyond the painting.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Oh.</em> Severus felt the slightest bit of relief knowing he
    wouldn’t suffer alone this  time. “It is inexcusable, Albus, and I would
    hope that you will strongly  consider this event the catalyst needed for
    their immediate dismissal! They  illegally entered my domicile and invaded
    my privacy! I can only imagine how  badly the rest of the school is faring
    from such a ludicrous display.”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, they didn’t prank everyone, Severus. Just you.”  Albus pulled him along
    through the painting as well.
</p>
<p>
    “But you just said-”
</p>
<p>
    “It was merely by accident that my own quarters were  affected. You see,
    when Fred and George affixed their experimental spell to  your sitting room,
    it extended not only to your fireplace, but through the Floo  as well. And
    since yours is directly connected to my own, the effects spilled  out into
    my rooms. Or rather, an interesting breadcrumb trail of flowers leading  up
    and into my bathroom, where they decided to flourish most splendidly.
    Especially in my toilet. I must say that seeing Snapdragons grinning up at
    me in  such a fashion was quite amusing.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus allowed himself to be shunted into a chair set  down beside a little
    nook table near the largest hearth. His mind was still  recovering from the
    old man’s whimsical diatribe. “Did you say <em>experimental</em>?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes.”
</p>
<p>
    “And they are still employed?!”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes.”
</p>
<p>
    “Albus! This is preposterous! You cannot allow them to  remain here if they
    are performing experimental magic! They could-”
</p>
<p>
    An elf with far too many hats on its head approached  them. “Is the
    Headmaster and the Good Professor Snape wanting something from  the
    Kitchens, sirs?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>Good?!</em>
</p>
<p>
    “No!” Severus yelled, just as Albus softly spoke, “Of  course, Dobby.”
</p>
<p>
    The old fool continued speaking to the little bugged-eyed  menace. “We would
    like two of your wonderfully restorative cocoas, please.”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, yes sirs. Dobby is most pleased to provide for you,  sirs.” He
    scampered off quickly and Severus pressed his advantage.
</p>
<p>
    “Albus, I-”
</p>
<p>
    “Come now, Severus. No harm has been done and both Fred  and George have
    promised me that they will not do it again.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus was about to explode. “And no such consequences  faced, I presume?!”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, they will have consequences, Severus. I may feel the  need to be more
    lenient with staff and students while we continue to adjust to  a
    post-Riddle environment, but that does not mean they will go without being
    reprimanded appropriately. Rest assured they are already ‘facing the music’
    as  it were, and they will continue to face it for the rest of term.”
</p>
<p>
    “But that’s only for another week!”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes. Well, the severity of their punishment is such that  they could not
    withstand it for very long.”
</p>
<p>
    “What sort of punishment?” Severus asked warily.
</p>
<p>
    “That is between me and them.”
</p>
<p>
    “Of course.” Severus conceded.
</p>
<p>
    “I must say, that is a lovely fragrance about you,  Severus. You haven’t
    been wandering the Grounds today, by any chance?” Albus  questioned
    knowingly.
</p>
<p>
    His stomach swooped. The primrose! Oh, why hadn’t he  thought to conceal it
    before he left his rooms?! He’d been too concerned with  removing the
    wretched stuff to even question hiding it, and then his fury took hold,  and
    he stormed out to kill those little bastards.
</p>
<p>
    Severus fought for composure, forcing the pink tinge to  fade from his
    cheeks. “Just part of the Weasleys’ latest… <em>prank</em>.” He  spat the
    last word.
</p>
<p>
    Albus hummed in thought.
</p>
<p>
    Severus very nearly cursed the old man sitting next to  him. “I suppose this
    doesn’t count towards their termination either?” he  snarled.
</p>
<p>
    Albus sat quietly for a moment, pondering  Merlin-knew-what before
    answering. “I think not, Severus. However, they did not  inform me of this
    particular effect as part of their prank. I will need to  discuss it with
    them to determine the appropriate punishment.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus was about to rage at the old goat, but the  clinking of dishes
    marked the return of that annoying little elf. He huffed and  flicked his
    wand tersely, cloaking the stinking scent emanating from his body. Once again
    his demands had been dismissed.
</p>
<p>
    The elf placed two steaming mugs full of frothy cocoa  before them
    accompanied by a small plate of shortbread. Then he bowed low  enough that
    his nose nearly touched the ground, somehow managing not to lose  any of
    those hideous hats in the process.
</p>
<p>
    “Thank you, Dobby. You are a true delight.”
</p>
<p>
    The wretched elf wailed with pride, thanking Albus  profusely before
    retreating to his chores.
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, you should drink up while your cocoa is still hot,  my boy.”
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t like cocoa.”
</p>
<p>
    “That’s strange. I could have sworn you enjoyed  chocolate… with orange
    peel, yes? Hmm, perhaps I’m thinking of someone else.”
</p>
<p>
    “L-lupin.”
</p>
<p>
    “Ah… Then it was the Darjeeling that you fancied, wasn’t  it?”
</p>
<p>
    “That’s also Lupin.” Severus growled. He couldn’t take  this. He didn’t want
    to be anywhere near thoughts about-
</p>
<p>
    “Oh yes, of course. Now, I remember.” Albus chuckled. “I  can’t image why I
    would be confusing you for Remus yet again.” He sipped his  cocoa before
    continuing, “Especially since I know how <em>fond</em> you are of <em>black</em>
    coffee.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus froze, his eyes meeting the Headmaster’s  unwavering gaze as he
    continued to silently sip his cocoa.
</p>
<p>
    <em>He knows</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The room was suddenly all too warm for Severus, the blood  rushing through
    his ears. He rose swiftly from his chair, straightening his  robes,
    determined to leave before the old man could further interrogate him.
</p>
<p>
    Albus sighed. “My dear boy. I wish you would allow  yourself the freedom
    to-”
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t!” Was all that Severus could manage.
</p>
<p>
    Albus continued to stare at him, that piercing gaze now laced  with pity.
    “Very well. But I will say this one thing to you, Severus.” He spoke
    softly, “The War is over. You are free.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus could hold his temper no longer. “Free, am I?!  And what do you call
    being shackled to this abominable School?! That the  Ministry saw fit to
    chain me here for <em>‘probation’</em> under your watchful  eye. A watchful
    eye, I might add, that is at this very moment putting his  crooked nose into
    things he has no business with in the first place!” He was  panting hard,
    fighting to control his anger and keep his mask from slipping  entirely.
</p>
<p>
    “It’s only for five years, two of which are nearly  completed already. And”
    Albus added, raising a hand to stop Severus  interrupting again. “I have
    secured a meeting with Kingsley during the term  break. He is confident that
    the Wizengamot will listen to my demands that you  be pardoned early for
    ‘good behavior’.” Albus took a moment to sip his cocoa  once more before
    continuing. “Although, he did caution me that the deliberation  will take
    quite some time, and that you may still be forced to endure the  summer
    term, as well as next autumn. Also, there are several members of the council
    who are fighting to put you into Azkaban at this very moment. I will need to
    counter their arguments heartily before we can set an agreement for your
    release.”
</p>
<p>
    Pardoned early? No more Hogwarts. No more idiot children.  No more forced
    banter with irritating colleagues. He could set up business at  his island
    paradise and be rid of this suffocating life forever!
</p>
<p>
    “In the meantime,” Albus warned, “I would suggest you  find some way to
    relax. You are so tightly wound I fear you might quite literally  explode.”
</p>
<p>
    “I’m perfectly fine just as I am!” <em>Insufferable old busybody</em>.
    Severus glared at him.
</p>
<p>
    “Of course, you are. However, a little stress relief can  go a long way to
    helping your disposition remain palatable to others around  you. Perhaps, if
    you were to spend more time with your newfound interests, you  might-”
</p>
<p>
    “Enough!” Severus yelled. The interfering old man just  had to pry, didn’t
    he? How the hell did he always know everything?!
</p>
<p>
    Albus stared at him over his half-moon spectacles for several  moments
    before a pained sigh escaped him. “I only want you to be happy, my  boy.”
</p>
<p>
    Oh, that was it. “<em>Happy?!</em>” Severus shouted. “How  dare you say such
    a thing! For more than twenty years I have been under your  proverbial
    thumb, doing your bidding at every turn! Nearly everything I have  ever done
    in my life has been for-”
</p>
<p>
    “Lily.” Albus gently finished.
</p>
<p>
    Severus absolutely <em>hated</em> the old goat at that  moment. The way he’d
    been manipulated into servitude for more than half of his existence  because
    of his youthful mistakes. “It started that way,” he growled, “and it
    certainly was my only bastion throughout the War, but as you said,
    <em>
        the War  is over.
    </em>
    I have fulfilled my promise. I am finished with this entire, debilitating
    affair!”
</p>
<p>
    “Then we are in agreement.”
</p>
<p>
    “What?” Severus snipped.
</p>
<p>
    “You are no longer bound. You are free to pursue whatever  and
    <em>
        whomever
    </em>
    you like.”
</p>
<p>
    “My only pursuit is to fly from this infernal place!”
</p>
<p>
    “You shouldn’t keep such things bottled up. It would help  to discuss-”
</p>
<p>
    “There is <em>nothing</em> to discuss, and there never will  be!”
</p>
<p>
    Albus gave him one final piercing gaze. “If you’re sure…”
</p>
<p>
    “Quite.” Severus growled dangerously. He had to get away  from that face
    before he cracked. “I’ll take my leave, Headmaster. My afternoon classes
    await.”
</p>
<p>
    “Hurry along, then.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus turned quickly, his black robes billowing as he  disappeared through
    the Still Life entrance once more. The pity in the old  man’s eyes, too much
    to bear.
</p>
<p>
    He stalked towards the Dungeons rapidly, the fire in his  heels dissipating
    but slowly. No matter. Soon Severus would be in the  comforting atmosphere
    of his classroom with many young targets to vent his  fury.
</p>
<p>
    Just to be sure, he visited his quarters, verifying that  no more hijinks
    were at hand. Not even a hint of floral perfume remained. <em>Good</em>.  He
    made sure his mask was fully in place before crossing through his sitting
    room to the side door that led to the secret hall, taking him to his office
    and  finally the rear entrance of the classroom.
</p>
<p>
    Once he was there, Severus allowed himself a weary sigh.  He approached his
    chair, sat, and reached for his quill, intent on presenting  his most
    formidable self, appearing to mark essays. He wanted them on edge
    especially today as their focus would be on that wretched trip to Hogsmeade
    tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
    As he prepared to remove the quill from its inkwell, a  large bouquet of
    flowers in an ornate vase appeared before him seemingly out of  nowhere.
    After a moment spent in bewildered silence, Severus returned to his
    habitual, menacing glare. His eyes fell upon a small note tucked between the
    Scottish Bluebells, his own name written in a ridiculously embellished
    script  and accented with a drollery of flowers dancing all around it.
</p>
<p id="pBeforeWeasleyLetter">
    He plucked the card from the flowers, bringing it before  his steely gaze.
    He needn’t have read it to know just who it was from, but he  did it anyway.
    Misery loved company after all.
</p>
<p class="weasleyLetter" align="center">
    Severus,
</p>
<p class="weasleyLetter" align="center">
    A little  something to help brighten your day!
</p>
<p class="weasleyLetter" align="center">
    Yours
</p>
<p class="weasleyLetter" align="center">
    Messrs  Weasley
</p>
<p id="pAfterWeasleyLetter">
    Severus crushed the delicate missive in his palm, a  vicious snarl escaping
    him as he did so. The impudence! The sheer, unmitigated  gall! It was too
    much to bear. Before he could tamp down his rage, the vase  exploded,
    sending shards of pottery across the room, a large chunk striking the  back
    of his right hand. Bits of bluebells rained down on him like confetti.
    Severus  stood from his chair, shaking, breathing in fervid huffs. Oh, he
    would get  those menacing little shits.
</p>
<p>
    The bell rang, signaling the start of class. His students  would be arriving at
    any moment. Severus reigned in his anger, vanishing the vase  shards and
    confetti of bluebells, before tending to his marred flesh. The cut  looked
    much worse than it felt, barely a sting at all, and easily healed with a
    nonverbal spell. Severus hesitated. It would be improper to let the
    dunderheads  see him so injured, however it would help to maintain their
    suspicions of him. But  Albus would probably set him down for another
    ‘talk’. No. Better to appear  physically undamaged.
</p>
<p>
    Severus compromised by standing in front of his desk and  leaning against
    the edge with his arms folded. He projected his most terrifying  sneer and
    surveyed each student in turn as they entered his domain. The  sixth-year
    class shuffled quickly to their seats, trepidation in many of their  eyes.
    Just as it should be. A relaxed student was dangerous in a lab full of
    potentially lethal ingredients.
</p>
<p>
    Severus was grateful there were no Slytherins in the  room. He hated taking
    points from his own House. When each student was seated  and silently
    awaiting their instructions, he began, the eerie calm about him  only
    terrifying them further. There would be no warning of his coming wrath
    today.
</p>
<p>It was a venerable nightmare for his young charges, and all in all, a
    total of 65 points lost between Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw before the bell
    rang  to dismiss them.
</p>
<p>
    It did little to assuage Severus, his ire still aflame. He needed to find
    those Twits. They needed to pay for what they had done to him! The Duo
    could often be found in the Staffroom between classes or sometimes  for
    afternoon tea. He would check there first. If they were not present, he
    would stalk down to Hagrid’s. He wished Rubeus had better sense than to keep
    company with reprobates. The man was far too trusting.
</p>
<p>
    Severus headed to the Staffroom, intent on flaying them alive. When he arrived
    however, it was to find only Flitwick and Sprout taking an early
    tea that day. <em>Damn it all!</em>
</p>
<p>
    “Good afternoon, Severus.” Filius greeted him with a  timid squeak, noticing
    the fire set about his younger colleague.
</p>
<p>
    “Afternoon.” Severus addressed them both curtly, unable  to keep the wrath
    entirely from his voice.
</p>
<p>
    “Care for a spot?” Pomona offered, holding out a delicate  china cup and
    saucer.
</p>
<p>
    “No.”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, come now. It’s Darjeeling, and there are biscuits as  well.” she
    intoned, splashing the milk into the cup and pouring the tea over it  before
    he could decline her offer.
</p>
<p>
    Severus stood there staring down at the steaming cup that  was pushed into
    his hands. <em>It just had to be Darjeeling, didn’t it? And milk!</em> He
    hated milky tea. He always had. And worse still, it reminded him of-
</p>
<p>
    “Here, have a Bourbon. They’re your favorite, aren’t  they?” She practically
    shoved the biscuit plate under his nose, offering him a  bright, albeit
    nervous smile with it.
</p>
<p>
    Severus barely had the wits to accept, his tumultuous  thoughts still
    encompassing those impossible Weasleys <em>and</em> The Couple. He numbly reached out  for the
    offered Bourbon, hating that he had such a weak spot for the
    chocolate-laden biscuits. <em>Just like him.</em> He absentmindedly nibbled
    the  corner, then sipped his tea. A sharp pang shot
    through  his stomach followed by a less-than-dignified grumble signaling its
    lack of  food within. It was only then that Severus realized he had skipped
    both his  breakfast and his lunch. He was immediately assaulted by a
    ravenous hunger, something  that had evolved way beyond the normal
    constraints of starving. All that rage  and plotting revenge must have
    worked up his appetite. He shoved the rest of the biscuit into his mouth
    and took a healthy swig of his tea.
</p>
<p>
    Pomona was about to hand the plate back towards Filius  when he snatched
    another Bourbon up and ate it quickly, not caring how  uncivilized he
    looked. Another mouthful of tea to wash that one down. The  richness of the
    sandwich soothing his vexations marginally, the chocolate-y goodness ensnaring
    his senses. It infused his thoughts and led him back to  memories of the
    previous night. Severus clenched his teeth so hard his jaw  began to ache.
    Darjeeling <em>and</em> chocolate! It was too much. Too much!
</p>
<p>
    <em>No! It doesn’t matter! Don’t allow</em> Them
    <em>
        to ruin your biscuit!
    </em>
    Severus was determined to prove just that and  snatched up the final
    Bourbon, shoving it into his mouth and gulping the rest  of his detestable
    tea. He didn’t care how ridiculous he looked while doing it.
</p>
<p>
    Neither Filius nor Pomona said a word but stared at him  as if he were a
    strange beast that had just rampaged into the room and began taking  tea
    with them. Sprout, her mouth hanging open. Flitwick, his brows furrowed in
    confusion.
</p>
<p>
    “Stop staring at me, you idiots!” Severus slammed his cup  and saucer down
    onto the service tray, cracking them irreparably. They flinched  backwards
    away from him, their confusion transforming into irritation. That would
    only fuel his tirade, and he relished the opportunity to tear them down in that moment.
    “Don’t  you have classes to attend to?! I’m sure it will take you quite some
    time to waddle  back out to your fecund abode, Pomona. And you!” Severus
    practically screamed  at Filius. “You’ll never make it up three flights of
    stairs in time, with such horrid  little, short legs!” They looked as if
    he’d slapped them across the face. Good.  Maybe they’d finally stop fretting
    over him.
</p>
<p>
    Just then, Aurora stuck her head through the door,  surveying the scene
    before her. Oblivious to what had just transpired, her eyes  sought out and
    eventually landed on the irate-looking younger man. “Oh, there  you are,
    Severus. I wanted to make sure you knew I would be well enough to  resume my
    duties tomorrow morning. I certainly appreciate your kind offer, but  it
    will no longer be needed.” She smiled warmly at him then nodded to the
    others, and with a “Cheery bye” she was gone.
</p>
<p>
    Severus was momentarily stunned rigid. How could the  woman speak of such
    things at a time like this?! “What is it with everyone and  their inability
    to act in a professional manner?! Stupid, blasted idiocies and  that
    infernal Hogsmeade fever!” He stormed out, slamming the door behind him.
</p>
<p>
    It was later than he’d thought when Severus finally  reached the Main
    Entrance. He’d completely lost track of time while berating  his colleagues,
    letting his temper get the better of him. There was no time to  visit
    Hagrid. No time to apprehend those little bastards. Hell, they probably
    weren’t even there anyway. Severus huffed and changed directions towards the
    Dungeons for his final class of the day. He would just have to wait to kill
    the  Twits until after dinner.
</p>
<p>
    Severus sighed painfully as he reached the lowest level  and rounded the
    hall to his classroom. He shouldn’t have let his anger take  control like
    that. It was at the very least rude to treat Pomona and Filius in  such a
    manner. He would need to apologise for his outburst at breakfast the
    following morning. They didn’t deserve the wrath that was reserved for the
    Twits.
</p>
<p>
    He sighed again, realizing just how stupid it made him  look to allow a
    couple of <em>children</em> to get under his skin so badly.  Severus needed
    to put the entire incident from his mind. He already knew that  Albus
    wouldn’t act upon it, so why waste his energy in pursuing it?
</p>
<p>
    Severus sighed yet again, knowing the truth of the matter  was not rooted in
    the Weasleys latest prank, but in <em>Them</em>. The Couple.  Why couldn’t he
    just let it go? He berated himself for how unhealthy it was,  continuing
    with a third encounter as he’d done. None of it should have ever  happened
    in the first place.
</p>
<p>
    As much as his self-loathing wanted to consume him, he  knew he could not
    give in, not now that he was about to walk through the  threshold of the
    Potions room. Once again Severus channeled it into a  comfortable rage,
    something to be alleviated through the ineptitude of his  charges. And he
    was not disappointed. His final class of the day had come to an  end and the
    students fled in terror upon his dismissal. Another 80 points were  lost to
    Gryffindor alone.
</p>
<p>
    Severus locked himself away in his rooms as thoughts of  the previous
    night’s escapade continued to swirl in his mind. It enraged him.  Consumed
    him. Tore him down. His Occlumency was in tatters.
</p>
<p>
    As he pushed a supper of Lancashire Hotpot around his plate, the voice of Poppy
    Pomfrey briefly flitted through his head, castigating him for not eating enough
    and remarking that he was still ‘far too thin’. He forced the food past his lips,
    chewing and swallowing as much as he could bear. His plate looked as if he hadn’t
    touched it. He pushed it away with an agitated sigh and summoned his Firewhisky.
    He'd need a drink if he was to get through another hellish night lost in the
    labyrinth of <em>Them.</em>
</p>


<p class="chapterTitle">Saturday</p>
<img class="pageBreak" src="../images/HP_Page%20Break_Transparent_Large_Purple.png">

<p>
    Saturday morning came and the castle inhabitants  slumbered on as Severus
    blearily rose at his habitual early hour. He was disoriented;  his eyes
    incapable of focusing on his surroundings. At last, he realized he was  in
    bed, though he knew not whether it belonged to himself or someone else. He’d
    never seen that particular patch of ceiling before and the fourposter was
    oddly  shaped. It was almost as if… <em>Ah.</em> He’d somehow
    managed to put  himself at the foot end of his bed.
</p>
<p>
    Severus sat up with great effort. His head was pounding,  and his mouth was
    filled with cotton wool. The customary effects of a long  night of drinking.
    He put his head in his hands and tried to recall the  previous evening. It
    only made his head hurt worse. He needed a sobering  potion. Now.
</p>
<p>
    Stretching towards his bedside table and hoping not to  encourage his
    throbbing head any further, Severus attempted to reach the top  drawer. He
    was roughly halfway along the bed, but it was still too far away.  There was
    nothing for it, he’d simply have to stand up and walk the rest of  the
    way.
</p>
<p>
    Severus was steadier on his feet than he thought he might  be, given how
    badly he felt, and he managed to get there on the first attempt.  Sliding
    the drawer open he reached inside but came up empty-handed. He examined  the
    contents of the drawer thinking that his addled state had left him off the
    mark. Every other potion lay inside but the one he desperately needed.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Fuck.</em>
</p>
<p>
    He kicked the bottom drawer and immediately regretted it as  the stabbing pain
    coursed its way through his bare toes and up his leg. “Fuck!”  Severus staggered
    backwards and collapsed onto his bed, breathing deeply  through his nose and
    hoping nothing was broken. Concentrating hard, he summoned  his wand to him
    as the pain continued to radiate from his abused foot. It soared  through
    the air from the direction of his sitting room.
</p>
<p>
    Severus never let his wand out of his sight. Something  truly terrible must
    have happened for him to do so. He flicked his wand, and a  sobering potion
    quickly flew towards him from his private lab. When it too was  in his hand
    he finally relaxed. He uncorked the vile and quaffed it greedily.
</p>
<p>
    The soothing effects were immediate, his vision cleared,  his headache
    evaporated, and his mouth was no longer dry as a desert. Severus  allowed
    himself a moment to collect his wits before attempting to examine his
    memories of the previous night.
</p>
<p>
    It had been terrible indeed. At first, it had only been  drinking in the
    hopes of cooling his temper, but after the fourth whiskey he  was drinking
    to forget. Forget the other night. Forget those soft words and  softer
    forest-coloured eyes. Forget the harshness and the bitter entanglement.
    Forget that it was only supposed to be fucking when he really wanted more.
    Forget that he had ever allowed himself such a notion. Forget that he had
    been offered  more. Forget that he wanted to accept. Forget that he didn’t
    want to hate them.  Forget that he could never have something so wholesome
    in his life. So  comforting and familiar. Safe. Loved.
</p>
<p>
    That last thought had him rushing to the loo and retching  up the meager
    contents of his stomach. His hands shook in their attempt to rinse  his mouth
    and wash his face afterwards. He closed his eyes, bracing himself  against
    the basin to regain control. Images flooded his mind once more. The  gentle
    caress of a palm across his cheek, how he’d pressed his face into the  soft
    pads of those fingers. A delicate kiss along his neck.
</p>
<p>
    <em>No!</em>
</p>
<p>
    He had to stop. Had to stop this now. There would be no  more thoughts on
    the subject. It was nothing. It meant nothing. It was over.  Severus had
    already made that decision. He was absolutely finished with them. He’d  go
    so far as to hex either one if they ever approached him again!
</p>
<p>
    <em>It would be pointless, anyway. You can never have what you do not deserve…</em>
</p>
<p>
    Severus finished his perfunctory ablutions and dressed in  his usual severe
    manner, mentally preparing himself for the morning ahead. Most  of the
    castle would still be asleep at this hour on the weekends normally, but  he
    just knew there were already people queueing for Hogsmeade. He hated those
    breakfasts. Those brats and their restless shuffling, the excitement
    elevating  the decibel to teeth-grinding levels.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Enough! Do what you have always done when  faced with a dire situation.
        Occlude and remove yourself from your surroundings  as best you can.
    </em>
    Severus consoled himself with the fact that  the wretched meal would be over
    quickly as the masses wandered down to the  village in haste.
</p>
<p>
    Once again, he made his way to the High Table and took  his customary seat.
    Babbling was looking anywhere but at him. <em>Good.</em> Albus smiled at
    him. <em>Ugh.</em> The rest of the staff seemed absorbed in the  usual
    weekend banter. Severus reminded himself of the apologies owed to Filius
    and Pomona. He would give them soon, but first his coffee. He reached for
    his cup,  filled to the brim with the strong Ethiopian blend he favoured so
    much. Severus  knew it would take him just as far away as the country itself
    and readily welcomed  the momentary separation into caffeinated oblivion.
</p>
<p>
    The cup was barely to his lips and already Severus was  desperate to inhale
    the bewitching aroma, taste the strong, bitter brew on his  awaiting tongue.
    He cared not if it scalded him. The searing liquid would be a  welcomed
    distraction from the chatter all around. Finally, after what seemed  like
    ages, his lips touched the rim of the cup.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Gah!!!</em>
</p>
<p>
    It was not coffee.
</p>
<p>
    Severus couldn’t stop his visible- and quite audible- outcry,  which was
    noticed immediately by the surrounding staff and students. So, what?!  Let
    them stare! He had a much bigger problem than worrying about whether or not
    he was making a scene. His coffee! His precious coffee!!! For what had only
    moments ago been his coveted drink, was now something entirely different.
    And  he knew immediately exactly what it was. <em>Treacle?!</em> How in all
    of  Merlin’s name had that happ-
</p>
<p>
    <em>WEASLEYS!!!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Those horrible, rotten connivers had done it to him  again! Although he had
    no idea what exactly they were attempting with this  stunt, it nevertheless
    left him enraged once more. He quickly reined himself in  though. No further
    outbursts. It would be too suspicious. He would need all his  stealthy
    cunning if he were to succeed in truly killing them this time.
</p>
<p>
    Just as he was having decidedly malicious thoughts about  all the ways in
    which he could obliterate them, the strangest sensation spread  across his
    body and out over his limbs. Severus had never experienced anything  quite
    like it, and the closest thing that came to mind was a combination of a
    Disillusionment charm and Polyjuice potion.
</p>
<p>
    Severus examined his person and gasped. A fine,  shimmering sheen of
    <em>
        something
    </em>
    was covering his hands that looked  suspiciously like the contents of his
    cup. He rubbed his thumb and forefinger  together. Yes, it was definitely
    syrup. And as he studied the strange substance,  he noticed that it was not
    merely his hands that were affected. His wrists  revealed the same thing,
    and where they met the cuffs of his robes, he could  feel the stickiness
    adhering to them and chafing his skin. In fact, Severus felt  that same
    chafing all over his body.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Oh, Merlin!</em>
</p>
<p>
    It was everywhere! The bizarre stuff against his legs was  suctioning him to
    his trousers. The fabric of his shirtsleeves was plastered up  into his
    armpits. His back felt as if it were literally stuck to his chair. His  toes
    felt even worse, the squidginess between them enough to drive him
    completely mad.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Don’t panic… Analyse.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Severus rubbed his fingers and thumb together and down  against his palm.
    The treacle-like substance was malleable but did not give way  entirely, and
    no matter how forcefully he pressed his fingers together, he  could not make
    direct contact with his skin.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Don’t. Panic.</em>
</p>
<p>
    He could see from the corner of his eye that everyone was  still staring at
    him. Severus could only imagine what he must have looked like,  sitting
    there with his face covered in shimmering golden syrup. And even as he
    thought this, another peculiar thing happened. The scent of primrose filled
    the  air.
</p>
<p>
    His cloaking charm had failed.
</p>
<p>
    Soon, everyone would smell it and there would be no  recovering from that
    truly hellish nightmare.
</p>
<p>
    Quickly, Severus grabbed his wand, hoping that he would  be able to grasp it
    properly to cast a cleansing charm and hide the floral odor  once more. Yes.
    His grip was firm enough, his movements succinct. He finished  the spells
    and waited for the strange afflictions to disappear… and nothing  happened.
</p>
<p>
    Severus cast again.
</p>
<p>
    Nothing.
</p>
<p>
    He did not panic, although he felt the stirrings of dread  in his bones. He
    sat there immobile, running through all the plausible spells  in his head to
    remove such a thing. Severus tried each in turn to no avail. He’d  run out
    of spells. There was nothing else he could do. But Severus was not
    finished. Perhaps manual labour was called for in this instance? He
    moistened  his serviette with a delicately cast <em>Aguamenti</em> and
    applied pressure to  his right hand with the cloth held in his left. The
    substance remained impervious.
</p>
<p>
    Severus felt his control slipping, small tremors in his  hands, his
    breathing subtly erratic. He rubbed again… Then he rubbed <em>harder</em>…
    Then he rubbed <em>harder still</em>… He rubbed so vigorously that his skin
    would  surely come off, but the blasted stuff was stuck fast to his person!
</p>
<p>
    <em>Circe’s Tits!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Those Weasleys were dead! How dare their impudence! How  dare they attempt
    to make him a laughingstock amidst the rabble! He no longer  cared for the
    patience of gutting them, nor the secretiveness with which to do  so
    effectively. He would kill them where they stood, right in this very Hall!
</p>
<p>
    The foulness of his rage was tremendous, pulsating outward like invisible
    waves of Dark sludge. The hall around him growing steadily dimmer from the
    force of his suppressed magic. The other teachers merely sat there as still
    as statues gaping at him.  They could all go fuck themselves.
</p>
<p>
    Severus turned his head sharply then, glaring at the  accustomed place where
    the Weasleys sat each day. If looks could kill… But as  he expected to find
    them both there, holding their middles as they suffered  through a hearty
    bout of guffaws at his expense, they were not. In fact, as he  looked around
    the room, they were entirely absent from it. Severus, still  seated at his
    place, resembled a powder keg about to blow.
</p>
<p>
    Everyone, not just the staff, was staring at him now in  rigid trepidation.
</p>
<p>
    “Professor Snape?” Albus queried. He gave Severus a  severe look over his
    specs, an unspoken question in his gaze.
</p>
<p>
    Severus’ tumultuous thoughts kept him from answering.  Where were those
    impossible bastards?! He had to find them, had to make them  rue the day!
</p>
<p>
    Albus cut through his deadly thoughts like a knife. “I  think it would be
    best if you were to visit Madam Pomfrey now, don’t you?”  Another severe
    gaze, this time a warning and a demand wrapped into one.
</p>
<p>
    Severus compounded all his strength to contain the  conflagration in his
    soul. It would have engulfed the entire Hall in mere  seconds otherwise. He
    gave himself a moment, not wanting to appear unsteady on  his feet, then
    made to stand-
</p>
<p>And was immediately yanked back towards his seat.</p>
<p>
    He was stuck.
</p>
<p>
    He was well and truly stuck to the blasted chair!
</p>
<p>
    Oh, those fucking little shits! Could they possibly have  chosen a worse
    thing to destroy the tattered remains of his dignity?! Severus released a
    fiery growl, silently casting a powerful shield charm as he did so. Then
    pushed to his feet with all the force he could muster and sliced his wand
    though the air with a single deadly stroke. The ancient chair fighting to
    remain attached to him exploded.  Waffles and  eggs
    and pumpkin juice everywhere were peppered with specks of dust.
</p>
<p>
    Albus gave him a <em>very</em> sharp look then, and he knew  there would be
    more than a reprimand if he caused any further scene in front of  the
    students. Severus reluctantly let his anger ebb away just enough so that he
    could manage to stalk through the door towards the Hospital Wing. He didn’t
    want to go, but he knew if he disobeyed Albus and did not see Poppy, he
    would  be in even worse condition.
</p>
<p>
    He could handle a short detour. It would only take five  minutes to reach
    her on the First Floor, perhaps another ten minutes of her  fussing and
    chastising. Then, <em>then</em> he would be free to set loose his ire  once
    more, and oh, how those two ne’re-do-wells would suffer!
</p>
<p>
    Severus was luckier than he’d hoped. It turned out that  Poppy had no idea
    how to get rid of the stickiness and with his protestations  she sent him on
    his way in only five minutes. Of course, his luck ran out as he  reached the
    double doors of the Hospital and Albus appeared before him.
    <em>
        How  does he always do that?!
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, Severus, finished already?” His quiet tone belied  his irritation.
</p>
<p>
    He knew he would need to downplay his fury or Albus would  never let him go.
    “Yes. Unfortunately, Poppy was incapable of helping. However,  I have
    convinced her to allow me my own attempt at devising a potion.” It  wasn’t a
    lie, just a slight stretch of the truth. He fully planned on returning  to
    his lab in the hopes of creating something to remove the sticky substance,
    but that was to wait until he had flayed <em>Messrs. Weasley</em> alive. “If
    you’ll excuse me, Headmaster.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus passed by the old man keeping his eyes trained on  the floating
    stairs at the end of the hall and managed all of three steps  before-
</p>
<p>
    “Severus?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>Ah, the dangerous voice.</em> Severus turned and gave Albus his full
    attention. “Yes, Headmaster.” He said as  politely as he could.
</p>
<p>
    “If you were thinking of taking out your anger on a  fellow staff member, or
    more than one,” Albus’ penetrating stare froze Severus  in his place, “the
    consequences would be… <em>severe</em>.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus did his best not to falter under such a lethal  stare. Even with his
    exceptional abilities, he was still no match for the aged  wizard currently
    holding him. He forced himself to calmly address the man. “You  know they
    are responsible for this.” Severus held up his hand in front of  Albus,
    shaking slightly as he did so.
</p>
<p>
    “No, I do not. And neither do you, unless I’m much  mistaken.” The
    underlying calm in Albus’ voice was terrifying.
</p>
<p>
    “Who else could it have been?! They invaded my rooms and  set up a garden
    yesterday! And when they received no response, they decided to  push it
    further! They will keep pushing and pushing until I become completely
    cracked! What more do you need to convince you that they have been in breach
    of  their contracts and damaged me?!"
</p>
<p>
    Albus sighed and waited for Severus to slow his  breathing. “It could merely
    be a coincidence.   Fred and George were not present this morning, I assume
    they were most  likely preparing for Hogsmeade. And there is no proof that
    what has transpired  was their doing. If, however, you can supply me with
    the evidence, I will of  course, properly reprimand them for their
    infraction.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus felt as if he would come apart at the seams. He  wanted to shout and
    rage at this senile old fool. He wanted to tear those  Weasleys apart with
    his bare hands!
</p>
<p>
    If not for his decades-long espionage, he wouldn’t have remained  so
    outwardly calm. He had the feeling Albus could see right down to his soul
    though  and knew exactly what he was planning. He tried to speak then, but
    his rage was  still too volatile. He couldn’t be certain that he wouldn’t
    completely fuck  himself over and lose his chance at an early pardon.
</p>
<p>
    “Now, my boy.” Albus said sternly, but kindly. “I think  it would be best
    for you to return to your rooms and begin working on your  potion. If you
    require any assistance, I shall be there to help.” He gently  laid a hand on
    Severus’ shoulder without flinching at the stickiness there,  giving him one
    last penetrating look. “Off you go.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus trudged back down to his rooms in a daze, numbly  taking those
    secret passages that would allow him to avoid anyone along the  way. Lost in
    thought, he mechanically unwarded the door and entered his sitting  room.
    How best to proceed? Severus sighed exhaustively as he would at the end  of
    a very long day, yet it was only half nine in the morning. He wanted a bath.
    How that would work out he wasn’t sure, since the treacle-y sheen was stuck
    fast to him. Perhaps a shower would be easier?
</p>
<p>
    Severus removed his soiled clothing carefully, having no  idea how it would
    ever be clean again. It took a great deal of effort and made  him curse his
    many buttons at one point, but eventually he had it all tossed  aside. It
    was such a miserable looking mess on his floor. Oddly enough it reminded
    him of a large, bedraggled black cat that had been caught out in the rain.
</p>
<p>
    On second thought, Severus decided to place them in the basket,  knowing
    that an elf would be expecting his clothing and pop in to collect it  that
    evening. He didn’t like the idea of tongues wagging over his laundry, but
    he liked the idea of the little buggers discussing the absence of it even
    less.  Things always had a way of getting back to Albus, and he felt sure
    that somehow  this would lend credence to further meddling with his life.
    Hopefully the elves  could manage to have it neatly pressed before dawn. If
    not, he had spare sets  to choose from in the morning.
</p>
<p>
    His boots…
</p>
<p>
    Oh, his poor boots.
</p>
<p>
    Severus wasn’t positive, but he thought setting them on  fire might be the
    only solution. He tossed them in with his clothes. If anyone  could mend
    them, it would be the house-elves of Hogwarts.
</p>
<p>
    He headed for the bathroom and straight into the shower,  setting the taps
    to just below scalding. He needed it today. As he stepped  under the spray
    the tension began to ease from his taut muscles. Not entirely-  that would
    only be possible if he were successful in hunting down those  atrocious
    Twits and reducing them to dust- but at least it was something.
</p>
<p>
    The water cascaded from the top of his head and fell to his  shoulders, then
    sluiced down his torso, and trailed to his arms and  legs in
    rivulets to the tips of his fingers and toes. He loved having a shower.  He
    loved having a bath even more. And he took every opportunity to do just
    that. He was limited by the time constraints of his classes and other
    duties,  but there was usually at least some time for a relaxing and quite
    lengthy ablutions  session at some point.
</p>
<p>
    Despite what many thought of him, Severus cared very much  about his
    hygiene. The feeling of freshly scrubbed skin against his soft woolen
    clothes was one of the only things in his life that made it bearable. During
    both Wars and the years spent teaching Potter, he was  often preoccupied to the
    point of neglectfulness- making his naturally oily hair all the more noticeable-
    but never when he needed to  brew. As a potioneer, it was essential to ensure
    that no foreign bodies- or as  little as possible anyway- contaminated the process.
    Severus would have been a  worthless excuse for a Potions Master otherwise, and an
    unforgivable blemish on  the society that had helped to foster his
    profession. He would not allow his  years gaining a Mastery to be put to
    shame.
</p>
<p>
    Severus kept a variety of soaps at his disposal for when  his experimental
    potions backfired or for the occasional disastrous brew from  students. He’d
    used a lot of it during the Longbottom years. He shook his head;  those were
    by far some of the worst teaching moments of his life. But the boy  had
    grown up. His confidence was evident in everything he touched these days.
    That, and he no longer had the <em>Greasy Bat</em> berating him nor one of
    the  dumbest duos in the history of Slytherin threatening his life
    constantly.
</p>
<p>
    Severus selected a soap that he thought might have the  best reaction and
    lathered up his body, not trusting to hope it would help. As  he washed, his
    thoughts began to unravel their tightly wound grip on his mind.  It was
    soothing enough that he felt himself being lulled into thoughts from
    Thursday evening and the reckless decision he’d made once again.
</p>
<p>
    He never should have stepped out, but the confines of the  castle had felt
    particularly suffocating that night. The Hogshead was too  familiar, and the
    Leaky would be filled with odious onlookers. He’d chosen a  little muggle
    pub south of Cokeworth, a place he frequented during the Second  War, when
    he’d felt uneasy leaving that jittery little Rat alone at Spinner’s  End for
    any length of time.
</p>
<p>
    Severus scoffed. Perhaps if the Ministry had not allowed  him the freedom to
    leave the castle in the first place, he never would have  gone through with
    it. He could still recall the sound of Kingsley’s voice,  rough from lack of
    sleep, the bags under his dark eyes clearly visible even  from his chained
    chair in the middle of the dungeon courtroom floor.
    <em>
        ‘Under  the terms of conditional parole set down by the Wizengamot this
        day, 3rd June 1998, we release the prisoner Severus Tobias
        Snape into the custody of  one, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,
        Headmaster of Hogwarts School for  Witchcraft and Wizardry, and Chief
        Warlock. There he shall remain for no less  than five years, lest the
        conditional agreement be approved for reevaluation  before that time.
        And until said time has been commuted, the parolee may be  afforded no
        less than two hours of unsupervised activity daily, and the freedom  to
        explore the surrounding Great Britain. Should the parolee fail to adhere
        to  these orders, take up violence against any citizen either magical or
        muggle, or  flee the country, he will be remanded to Azkaban
        indefinitely barring any new  case against him.’
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Severus often wondered whether it had been Kingsley’s  idea alone that
    granted him such leniency. There was certainly no shortage of  bastards in
    the courtroom wanting to lock him up in that Hellhole and throw  away the
    key. When it was all over- before Severus popped out of wizarding  Britian’s
    existence and into his awaiting tropical paradise- he hoped there  would be
    time in the busy Minister’s schedule to discuss it. As much as Severus
    hated everything about his agonizing situation, he felt the man deserved a
    proper thank you for his efforts.
</p>
<p>
    He sighed painfully, thinking again of all that had  transpired the other
    night. If he’d just stayed in his rooms, he never would  have run into
    <em>
        Them.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The pub he’d chosen was quiet enough, allowing him to  settle back into a
    darkened corner like some damned great spider hiding in the  shadows. He
    sipped his Talisker at the little table in relative peace, the  muggles
    taking no notice of him other than to further distance themselves from  his
    scowling face.
</p>
<p>
    Then <em>They</em> came through the door and ruined  everything. The Couple
    were celebrating some sort of anniversary, a folly from  their youth that
    had spilled over into the establishment before its end.  Severus pulled
    himself further back into the corner, grateful that his  customary black
    afforded him such camouflage. It didn’t stop them sniffing him  out though.
    That had been a particular talent of Re-
</p>
<p>
    Severus huffed forcefully, berating himself for reliving  those moments yet
    again. He had to let it go. He just had to! He was done with  them! He
    truly, truly was… So why couldn’t he stop thinking about them? What  the
    hell had happened to him?! In all his life, he’d never been so foolish!
    Well, almost never. But nothing had ever seemed as bad as this fucked up
    dalliance.
</p>
<p>
    It was only meant to be a single night to forget…
</p>
<p>
    Something that he never would have thought possible  beforehand…
</p>
<p>
    Because he absolutely hated them. Utterly loathed the  pair of them!
</p>
<p>So how could he have gone through with it, then?!</p>
<p>
    Gods, but he was a fool!!!
</p>
<p>
    And that night, oh how he’d needed them- No! Not them. <em>It!</em>  He had
    needed <em>it</em>. For that’s all it was. Just fucking. Nothing more. It
    could have been anybody.
</p>
<p>
    That little voice came creeping back to the forefront of  his mind then.
    <em>[But it wasn’t just anybody, and you weren’t looking for</em> it
    <em>
        before they happened along…]
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Severus pressed the palms of his hands into his eyes,  letting the pressure
    distract him. Not the best solution, for now that his eyes  were closed
    visions of their previous encounters as well as Thursdays’ flooded  his
    mind. Forest eyes beseeching, silver eyes daring. Lips and tongues and
    teeth exploring, hands roaming. So much naked flesh!
</p>
<p>
    Severus felt his body reacting and growled in  frustration. He stared down
    at his half-hard cock. <em>Traitor!</em> He shut off  the hot water and
    hissed at what felt like tiny shards of ice hitting his skin.  It was worth
    it to kill his insistent erection.
</p>
<p>
    He shut off the water entirely and stepped out, shivering  slightly as he
    did so. Better to chance hyperthermia than the possibility of  succumbing to
    self-pleasure. He didn’t think he’d survive the shame from that  one.
</p>
<p>
    Severus reached for the large, rough towel hanging next  to him and wrapped
    it securely around his body. The tremors subsided quickly  then, allowing
    him to focus on the problem at hand once more.
</p>
<p>There was no chafing of the cloth against his skin… </p>
<p>The stickiness had gone! </p>
<p><em>Thank Merlin!</em></p>
<p>However, the strange, shimmering sheen on his skin was still present as well as the
    horrid  floral perfume. He’d need to work out a potion to remove them both.
</p>
<p>
    He wondered if it would be possible to hide the sheen in  the interim? It
    had worked on the primrose after all. Severus cast a series of cloaking  and
    disillusionment charms on himself until he finally found a combination that
    suppressed both of them at once. Now, even if he couldn’t devise a potion to
    remove them, which he <em>would</em>- there was no questioning his skill and
    tenacity- he wouldn’t be subjected to the whisperings of the castle
    inhabitants.
</p>
<p>
    He pulled a modest set of loose-fitting robes and a pair  of soft slippers-
    both black, of course- from his wardrobe. Although it was not  his standard
    dress, it was comfortable. And being comfortable while brewing for  a
    lengthy period was preferable to enduring the aches and pains that arose
    from  his usual severe attire.
</p>
<p>
    Severus was probably the only one in Hogwarts that  understood just how
    taxing it could be to wear a frock coat all day long. But  the constraints
    of his formal wear were a necessary part of teaching. His rigid posture
    made him far more unapproachable and thus added to the ‘Evil Death  Eater’
    persona. Most of his students were far too terrified to step out of line  in
    his class because of it. Well, most of the students. There was always one or
    two that pushed his patience to the point of breaking. Potter had been the
    worst of them.
</p>
<p>
    His strict approach to teaching had been for their own  good though. Potions
    were volatile if handled incorrectly. And Severus, despite  what many had
    thought, did not want a single child harmed. No. Not even Potter.
    Especially not Potter. No one would have ever believed him capable of caring
    for that highly irritating son-of-a-braggart, but he did. And not just
    because <em>she</em> was a part of him. Upon reflection, Severus had come to
    realize certain… <em>similarities</em> between their childhoods. The boy
    deserved at least a small amount of grace in  his short, miserable life.
</p>
<p>
    Severus brushed aside the thought and dressed himself quickly, donning
    what most people in wizarding society would surely have
    called loungewear. Clothing the likes of which would have instantly curled the hair
    on Lucius Malfoys’ head.
</p>
<p>And why not wear such things? It  wasn’t as if he
    were planning to go out in public where just anyone could see  him that
    afternoon. Oh, wouldn’t the little mites just love to gossip over  that! The
    Great Big Bat of the Dungeons kitted out like some doddering old loon  from
    St Mungo’s.
</p>
<p>
    Severus spent the rest of the afternoon working over his  cauldron, a vain
    attempt, for nothing that he tried would remove the strange  sheen from his
    skin. But, he reminded himself, at least he wasn’t sticky  anymore. He
    reached for his bottle of armadillo bile. <em>Damn it all!</em> He  was
    completely out.
</p>
<p>Severus huffed as he set the bottle down again with a hollow <em>clunk.</em> He would
    need to borrow from the school stores. They were always plentiful though,
    so it bothered his conscience very little at that moment. And besides, he simply
    <em>needed</em> that bile if he were to continue with his experimentation.
</p>
<p>He trudged irritably through his rooms toward the secret passageway that led to his office.
    Once inside, Severus trekked the length of the corridor as quickly as he could while clad
    in slippers, reaching the communal antechamber in a trice. Again, Severus felt
    grateful for this little nook that connected to all the places he most frequented. It was
    rather cunningly devised, and he’d often wondered whether Slytherin himself had constructed
    it in the days of the Founding.
</p>
<p>
    Severus opened the door to the rear entrance of his office and stepped out, but his foot did not come
    into contact  with the stone floor, at least not at first. No, there was something decidedly…
    <em>squidgy</em> in the way. The smell hit him even before he had the chance to
    look down at his slipper-clad foot.
</p>
<p>
    Dragon dung!
</p>
<p>
    <em>Fresh</em> dragon dung!
</p>
<p>
    Oh, the noxious <em>stench</em> of it!
</p>
<p>
    Severus’ eyes began to water before he could cover his nose,  both mind and
    body reeling from the pungent odor. He needed to regain control.  Assess his
    surroundings… W-what- how- How the fuck did a sack full of…
</p>
<p>
    <em>WEASLEYS!!!!!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Oh, those menacing little fuckers! How many times must  they torture him?!
</p>
<p>
    Severus quickly looked about to see whether or not they  used their
    experimental spell on it, but no, it was merely concentrated in this  single
    spot. Placed precisely where he was undoubtedly to set his foot as he  would
    step out from the door he most often used.
</p>
<p>
    Oh, he would kill them for sure this time! Albus and his  threats be damned!
    He would go to Azkaban, but what did that matter?! This  would be worth it.
    Oh, so worth it. Every torturous hour spent in a dark hole  with nothing but
    the shrieks of his fellow inmates for comfort would be worth  it!
</p>
<p>
    But first he needed to preserve the evidence. He cast a  stasis charm on the
    squashed mound below him, as well as the bit on his right slipper,  then he
    carefully removed it and-
</p>
<p>
    It was on his toes…
</p>
<p>
    How was that possible? The dung hadn’t leeched through  the fabric of his
    slipper. But even as Severus studied the stuff, it began <em>growing</em> up
    over his toes and onto his foot. First his metatarsals. Then his arch. Then
    his heel. His entire foot. And then the toes of his left foot began to feel
    squidgy…
</p>
<p>
    <em>Oh, Merlin, no!</em> Severus ripped off his left slipper to find the
    disgusting stuff to be adhered  to his other foot as well and growing in
    just the same manner. It was quickly  crawling upwards on both his ankles
    now. Then extending to his shins. His  calves. It was almost to his knees.
</p>
<p>
    Severus pelted back down the passageway, hoping beyond  hope that he would
    make it back into the shower before it reached his upper  thighs.
    <em>
        Why couldn’t the Dark Lord just have killed me during the Battle!!!
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    He made it not a moment too soon, vanishing all of his  clothes into
    nothingness and plunging himself under the hot spray once more. He  watched
    as the putrid mess rinsed away down the drain, nearly vomiting from the
    sight and the overwhelming stench of it wafting up towards him in the
    process. Severus  scrubbed himself raw after that- irritably taking note of
    the treacle-sheen  that was still present- but the smell lingered on. He
    scrubbed even harder,  employing the use of a specially formulated
    pumice-rich potion of his own  devising. Once he was positive that he
    couldn’t be any cleaner, and his fingers  were beyond prune-y, he turned off
    the taps, stepped out, and dried himself  off.
</p>
<p>
    But the stench was still there, strong enough that it even  managed to overpower the
    primrose. He smelled like a patch of flowers that had  been attacked by a
    feverish gardener with a bag of manure. Did he not wash  thoroughly enough?
    He must have done. Severus didn’t think he had much skin  left after that
    abrasive session. Perhaps it was simply the humid air  recirculating in the
    bathroom? He quickly cast a freshening charm around the  room, but the smell
    was <em>still</em> there.
</p>
<p>
    The slightest hint of paranoia was niggling in the back  of his mind, but
    Severus stamped it down before he could apply thoughts to the  feeling, or
    at least that’s what he tried to do.
</p>
<p>
    <em>It can’t be. It just can’t be… Please don’t  let it be so….</em>
</p>
<p>
    He looked at the sheen still glistening on his skin. He  dared not lift his
    hand to his face but knew that he must. As carefully as he  could, barely
    allowing his lungs any expansion, he sniffed.
</p>
<p>
    <em>GAAAHHH!!!</em>
</p>
<p>
    It was him! Again! He smelled- Oh! He couldn’t even think  it, definitely
    couldn’t admit to it out loud! But it was there just the same.  He couldn’t
    deny it. And no one else would ever be able to either. The scent of  fresh
    dragon dung had somehow permeated right through the sheen and into his
    skin. His entire body reeked of it! There would be no way to remove it
    unless  he got rid of the damned treacle-y stuff first. And he still had no
    idea how to  do that.
</p>
<p>
    Severus thought about taking the Floo to Albus’ office  draped only in a
    towel. Of storming right up to the old man and allowing him to  bear witness
    to the heinous act of those wretched Twits! But no. He had to get  this
    stuff off him. His skin crawled with the thought of what was embedded with
    its cells.
</p>
<p>
    He spent what felt like ages casting another set of  complicated spells to
    cloak the scent and grabbed another set of robes from his  wardrobe. There
    were no more slippers, and his boots were out of commission, so  he was
    forced to make do with a warming charm on his feet to protect them from  the
    fridged Dungeon floor. Once Severus had taken a moment to Occlude as much
    as possible, he headed back to his lab.
</p>
<p>
    He spent the rest of his evening brewing, to no avail. And  no matter how
    much he screamed his frustration into the walls or pulled at his  stringy
    hair, nothing would change that. He exited towards his sitting room and
    headed straight for the Firewhisky. He needed to get as drunk as possible,
    as  quickly as he-
</p>
<p>
    “Severus?” Albus quired softly from the direction of the Floo.
</p>
<p>
    Severus nearly jumped out of his skin, wand raised faster  than he could
    blink, and nearly cast an Unforgivable on the old man before he  could rein
    himself in.
</p>
<p>
    “My boy, whatever is the matter?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>Oh, where to begin?</em> “The matter is <em>this</em>.” Severus
    cancelled the elaborate set of spells he’d  used to cover up the wretched
    stench as well as the sheen and Albus, as  courteous as he was, barely
    bulked at what must have been a highly unpleasant  thing.
</p>
<p>
    “I see.” Was all the old goat could say.
</p>
<p>
    “<em>Weasleys</em>.” Severus ground out through clenched  teeth.
</p>
<p>
    Albus sighed. “What happened?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“What happened?”</em> Severus gave him his most  incredulous look.
    “Does this,” he flailed his arms about, “not demonstrate it  well enough?!”
</p>
<p>Albus stared at him pointedly before sighing again. “Remain calm, and explain
    the situation to me, please.”</p>
<p>Severus knew that Albus was a patient man- as someone who had waited for the
    downfall of Tom Riddle for nearly three decades- but days like this sorely
    tried him. The old man was reaching the end of his tether with Severus, and
    this latest belligerent outburst wasn’t helping matters, but he just couldn’t
    keep from lashing out.</p>
<!--<p>-->
<!--    Albus was a patient man, as someone who had waited for  the downfall of Tom-->
<!--    Riddle for nearly three decades, but there were days that  sorely tried him.-->
<!--    He was reaching the end of his tether as far as Severus was  concerned.-->
<!--    Something had to be done about his belligerent attitude, and soon.  “Remain-->
<!--    calm, and explain the situation to me, please.”-->
<!--</p>-->
<p>
    Severus began a tirade that lasted nearly an hour, by the  end of which he
    was desperately in need of a throat soothing potion. He had informed  Albus
    of the dung in his office and showed him the evidence, he had reiterated
    the Weasleys’ plot with the strange sheen coating his body, being stuck to
    his  chair at breakfast, and those abominable flowers. He had broken it down
    into  the smallest, most concise words he could think of, as if he were
    explaining it  to a young child. And once again, Albus calmy told him they
    had no proof that  the Weasleys were involved.
</p>
<p>
    That mattered little to Severus now, for he would hunt  them down and flay
    them alive regardless. But the ferocious glint in Albus’  eyes told him that
    it would be a truly difficult task indeed while he was still  the
    Headmaster. The old goat headed back through the Floo to his own quarters,
    leaving Severus with another verbal reprimand and a final warning not to
    touch  his precious little lions. Not for the last time did Severus wonder
    just how  the barmy codger was capable of knowing so much.
</p>
<p>
    He reached the liquor cabinet in two strides, flinging  the doors wide and
    plucking his bottle of Firewhisky from its confines. There  would be no need
    for a glass tonight. Severus carried his precious salvation to  the old
    ornate wingback set before the crackling fireplace and dropped into it
    gracelessly, his well-scoured toes stuck out before him playing shadows
    against  the dancing light. Decorum was overrated anyhow.
</p>
<p>
    Severus rubbed his hand across his face, his fingers  coming to rest just
    above his eyes, easing the tension that pulsed in his  forehead. He felt
    little need to imbibe now, depressed as he was over his  failed brewing
    attempts. He sat there, the weight of it all pushing him further  down in
    his chair, wondering if it was possible for the ancient castle to  swallow
    him up right through the bottom of it.
</p>
<p>
    Severus had never encountered such difficulties with  potions before. There
    were always some setbacks when experimenting, but not  like this. He had to
    admit then, that it came down to being distracted in the  lab. Although
    Severus had been sure his Occlumency would hold throughout the  evening, his
    muddled thoughts had filtered through without his consent. The  Twits were a
    nearly constant presence in his mind now, the desire to hex them  ever
    increasing.
</p>
<p>
    But they were still entirely overshadowed by The Couple.  The memories of
    their liaisons were there every time he closed his eyes…
</p>
<p> <em>
    …Teeth  nipping earlobes, hands roaming over plains of taut muscle,
    pupils blown wide, gasps  and moans of blissful release… Tender kisses
    against his shoulder, arms draped  possessively, whispered promises
    scattered throughout the night, sighs of utter  contentment…</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>NOOO!!!</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Severus flung the bottle of Firewhisky with all his might  into the depths
    of the blaze, shattering it amongst the coals, flames leaping out  from the
    spent vapors towards the hearth. The explosive sound of the alcohol was
    quickly drowned out by the ragged breaths coming from his heaving chest.
    Severus dropped his head in his hands and wept, tears of frustration
    collecting  in his quivering palms.
</p>
<p>
    He had to rid himself of these memories permanently.  Occlumency was only a
    temporary fix. No one could sustain such a powerful drain  on their magic
    indefinitely. Oh, how he wished he could use his Pensieve! But  it was
    dangerous to remove one’s memories for an extended length of time. Severus
    had heard terrible tales of people who were never put to rights again. There
    were memory charms, but he didn’t trust anyone with his mind, not even
    Albus-  especially not Albus- the meddling old fool would undoubtedly try to
    convince  him otherwise.
</p>
<p>
    Severus hated this debilitating circle of thought. He  hated
    <em>Them</em> more. He hated himself far worse for being so fucking weak.
    Why… why did he want them, why did he need them so badly?
</p>
<p>
    Oh, and sure enough that little voice was back again.

<p>
    <em>

</p>
<p>
    <em>FUCK YOU!!!</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>[They… could be… your… Fiji…]</em>
</p>
<p>
    Severus screamed into the abyss until he felt his lungs  might collapse.
    Shakily, wearily, he staggered into his bedroom. A single  thought prevailed
    in his mind. Dreamless sleep. He hated using it. He’d built  up quite a
    nasty tolerance in the last two decades of his life. One day it  would be
    too much, and he’d never wake again. But he truly needed it tonight.  He
    couldn’t let <em>Them</em> in again. Severus uncorked the vials- for there
    were several now- of the only thing that would allow him to forget his most
    recent tragic mistake. He was asleep almost before his head hit the pillow.
</p>

<p class="chapterTitle">Sunday</p>
<img class="pageBreak" src="../images/HP_Page%20Break_Transparent_Large_Purple.png">

<p>
    It was well after dawn when Severus finally stirred, his  usual six o’clock
    forgotten in favour of a nice, comfortable 8.37 am.
    <em>
        Fucking  Dreamless Sleep!
    </em>
    Thank Merlin it was  Sunday, otherwise he’d have been rushing down the
    corridor, barely getting all  his buttons in place, and trying to warm the
    cauldrons before the brats could  suspect anything.
</p>
<p>
    As it was, most of the inhabitants of the castle would be up and about by now
    enjoying what remained of their weekend respite. Teachers
    breakfasting or perhaps strolling around the Lake. Children lollygagging and
    whatever else their small minds could conceive instead of studying.
</p>
<p>
    Severus, upon waking, noted the horrible stench of  primrose laced with
    dragon dung. His charms must have failed sometime during  the night. Gods,
    but it was awful! He quickly applied the cloaking spells to  his body once
    more, observing that it took far more concentration than usual. He  was
    stretching his magic too thin again.
</p>
<p>
    How the hell he’d slept through something so disgusting  was beyond him.
    Perhaps the Dreamless Sleep had done more than it was supposed  to and left
    him dead to the world? Yes, he was getting into dangerous territory  with
    that potion. He would need to stop. For good.
</p>
<p>
    Severus rose from the bed and went to relieve himself  before having a quick
    shower. He huffed irritably as he undressed, his robes  from yesterday were
    terribly wrinkled. He must have been truly exhausted to  have fallen asleep
    still wearing them.
</p>
<p>
    The robes he’d placed in his basket the day before had  been returned, clean
    and awaiting him in their customary location. Severus  would need to thank
    the elves for their tremendous effort, especially on his  boots. They looked
    brand new, not a bit of treacle nor anything else tarnishing  them. That at
    least gave him a modicum of comfort in light of his current  quandary.
</p>
<p>
    Severus dressed and headed straight for his personal lab.  He was determined
    to find a solution to his little problem today or never come  out again. Let
    them just try and remove him still alive from his sanctuary.  He’d take as
    many of them down with him as he could in the process.
</p>
<p>
    It was nearly lunch time before Severus had made any  progress at all. But
    at last, he’d finally reduced the primrose and dung to a  faint odor. Anyone
    standing too close would undoubtedly notice the ripeness of  him though.
    <em>He</em> certainly did. The sheen was still present, but it was far  more
    transparent than before and no longer shimmered unless he moved his limbs
    about.
</p>
<p>
    Severus was exhausted and felt rather faint before he realized  once again
    that he’d skipped breakfast. And his precious coffee. Three whole  days
    without caffeine- that bit of milky tea Friday afternoon didn’t count… No
    wonder he’d been in such a strop. And Severus realized something else as
    well. Not  only had he skipped breakfast, he’d <em>skipped</em> breakfast,
    missed the  communal meal… but Albus had not sought him out…
</p>
<p>
    He supposed the old goat must have taken pity on him in  his miserable
    state. Good. Severus didn’t care if it made him look weak. This  was an
    opportunity to be taken advantage of, and the very Slytherin part of him
    delighted in his momentary leave of absence.
</p>
<p>
    But what if this meant he was expected for lunch, or even  dinner? He
    dreaded the thought of it. Perhaps Albus would give him the entire  day to
    himself for once so that he could focus on his project.
</p>
<p>Then Severus remembered their monthly meeting.</p>
<p>
    <em>Damn it all! It would just have to be scheduled for today, wouldn’t it?!</em>
</p>
<p>But it wasn’t until half two though. He  would have just enough time to
    quickly eat something and prepare one more  potion before then.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, eating would mean either reporting to the  Great Hall or ordering
    food from the Kitchens to be delivered to his rooms. Both  of those
    prospects were less than favourable. In the end, Severus decided to  stay in
    as even the worst interactions with an elf were better than being  subjected
    to the nonsense of holiday-enthused children.
</p>
<p>
    Severus braced himself, knowing what was coming next, and  reluctantly
    called out into the silence surrounding him. “Dobby.”
</p>
<p>
    That damned, many-hatted elf popped into his room almost  before the final
    syllable was uttered. Severus had to worder at that. Was the  little
    blighter given orders to simply stand around just waiting to be called  by
    him? Albus would surely know, seeing as how he personally oversaw the
    reassignment of the elf to him after the War.
</p>
<p>
    Severus had nothing against the elf, but the little flop-eared  menace was
    so overly insistent that it made him grind his teeth. And all of it  because
    Dobby had discovered how he’d kept Potter safe all those years. Every  time
    the elf encountered him his huge green eyes would be brimming with unshed
    tears, a look of pure joy on his face. He would touch Severus’ arm as if to
    coddle, he would encourage him to eat and to rest as much as possible. If
    Severus hadn’t put his foot down and demanded the elf never fawn over him
    again,  he’d have gone insane from it long ago.
</p>
<p>
    As it was, Dobby had found him a plate of food without  being asked, setting
    it down before him on the small dining table adjacent to  the kitchenette.
    It was his favorite, too. Shepherd’s pie with mushy peas and jam  roly poly
    with custard. There was also an assortment of tea things, including
    biscuits, set to the side. And a coffee… Not the instant, like most of his
    colleagues preferred, but <em>his</em> Ethiopian Blend.
</p>
<p>
    The little elf had already vanished with another pop  before he could say
    thank you. Severus sighed, a pang of guilt stabbing him in  the gut- or
    perhaps it was hunger- as he realized that Dobby was worth more to  him than
    many others he’d encountered in his life. Severus made a mental note  to
    gift him a new hat for Christmas.
</p>
<p>
    Starving though he was, Severus opted for the coffee  first. It would most
    likely result in an upset stomach, having taken no food  the day before and
    very little water, but he just didn’t give a fuck. He inhaled the delicious
    aroma- his eyes closing of their own accord in pure rapture- and instantly the
    tension throughout his body lessoned…
</p>
<p>…Nearly melted through his chair and onto the floor with that first, eager sip…</p>
<p>…Practically moaned from its lustful course through his body as he drank more deeply…</p>
<p>…His heavy lids remaining closed as he continued to imbibe sinfully…</p>
<p>
    <em>
        [Soft smile and gentle chuckle… Challenging  bark and fierce grin… Sweet
        lips… Harsh tongue… Enveloped, cherished… Rolled, tumbled…  Deep as the
        forest… Bright as the stars…]
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Fuck!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Severus had let his shields down! <em>Again!</em> Let <em>Them</em> wind
    their way into his thoughts like some blasted Devil’s Snare! He hadn’t
    meant to close his eyes! He just wanted to enjoy his coffee!
    <em>
        Fucking involuntary reflexes!
    </em>
    He’d never be able to drink it again!!!
</p>
<p>
    His quarters were suddenly all too constricting,  claustrophobic even.
    Severus had to get out of the castle. Clear his head. Take  a stroll into
    the Forest. Yes, that should do it. He stood quickly then, a  little too
    quickly. Severus was shaky on his feet, not from rage, but rather  the
    assault by his immense hunger. He should have eaten first, damn it!
</p>
<p>
    He hadn’t felt this weak since the War. But he’d been  able to ignore it
    then and simply pump himself full of potions to stave off the  effects of
    living a double life and skirting the edge of death at every turn. He’d
    stopped abusing them since that time, well most of the potions anyway.
    Severus  wished he’d had the courage to keep it up. Why the fuck should he
    care if he destroyed himself? This hellish torment was far worse!
</p>
<p>
    He had to eat something before he left, he would never  even make it up to
    the Ground Floor in this condition. Severus tucked into his  pie, trying to
    ignore the bliss he felt as he chewed the delicate lamb and  spring
    vegetables hugging their rich gravy and mash. He forced roughly half of  it
    down, then drank his tea in two large gulps. He would not touch his coffee
    again for fear of what it might induce.
</p>
<p>
    Roughly sated for the moment, and rather stupefied from  such an onslaught
    of calories, Severus prepared himself for a walk in the  Grounds. He was no
    longer shaking. Good. He should be able to venture all the  way to the
    Forest then. The exercise would do him good as well. He’d barely  moved the
    past two days except to check his potions or fetch ingredients from  the
    cupboard.
</p>
<p>
    Severus cast a quick <em>Tempus</em> charm and discovered  it was only
    twenty minutes to one. He would have plenty of time to make it out  to the
    Forest and back again before the meeting. He would even have time to collect
    some Drifting Violets and assess the progress of the Bleeding Bittersweet
    near  the unicorn run if he hurried. If Hagrid didn’t spot him along the
    way, that is.  That man could talk you right into the ground when given the
    chance.
</p>
<p>
    He left the castle but did not exit via the Entrance  Hall. Instead, Severus
    took the secret passageway that led directly from his  quarters, the one
    he’d used more times than he’d cared to remember for <em>Meetings</em> that
    no one else was privy to. Albus had thought it a necessary addition
    during the First War, and he had been right. It saved him from any
    inconvenient  run-ins that would have otherwise made him tardy. The Dark
    Lord did not  tolerate unpunctuality from anyone.
</p>
<p>
    Severus stepped out into a sunny world filled with the  sights and sounds of
    spring. A sharp contrast to the prominent chill that was  present in the
    air. But the Highlands were always so this time of year. The  cold wasn’t
    biting by any means, but the gentle breeze that accompanied it  would
    occasionally stir up into lofty gusts filled with the dregs of winter and
    seep into your bones. The sort of thing that made Severus grateful for his
    woolen robes.
</p>
<p>
    If he were in better spirits, Severus might have taken  the time to
    appreciate such abundance all around him. He wasn’t completely made  of
    stone after all. And truth be told, he enjoyed watching the Grounds transform each
    year. From the russet and gold-dotted hillsides of autumn, to the
    snow-blanketed  forest in winter, through the rousing of anemones and
    bluebells in spring once  more, and the lush purple heather erupting across
    the greywacke in summer.
</p>
<p>
    As he drew near the Forest, Severus removed the striation  of cloaking
    charms enveloping his skin. It had been quite taxing these past few  days to
    keep them in place as well as his Occlumency shields. It was probably  the
    reason why both types of magic were failing him on occasion.  Either that,
    or he was dying. Hmm, that would  have been a welcome event. But no, Death
    had never seen fit to offer him  kindness. Severus would probably live for
    several hundred more years, withering  into frailness and forgetfulness
    before the end.
</p>
<p>
    It served him right, he supposed. His life had been  nothing but mistakes
    and regrets. Penance some would call it. If Severus truly believed  in any
    gods, he might agree with them.
</p>
<p>
    Oh, but he was getting into dangerous territory again. If  he wasn’t
    careful, his self-deprecation would carry him into the Black Lake.  Then
    Albus would most likely have a heart attack and the whole school would
    suffer another devastating upheaval. And Severus, well, they’d fish him out
    once the procession had ended and the Headmaster was laid to rest. No need
    to  worry beforehand, the Giant Squid would keep his body company.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Stop it! You sound just like Lup-</em>
</p>
<p>
    Severus groaned. No matter how hard he tried, his mind  always boomeranged
    right back to <em>Them</em>. His Occlumency- something that  Albus himself
    had said was greater than anyone’s, save his own ancient ability-  was no
    match for those infectious thoughts. Not even when Severus had attempted  to
    force them in his Strongbox- hidden in the deepest, most recessed portion of
    his mind- created specifically to keep the Dark Lord at bay.
</p>
<p>That was something very few people ever achieved through Occlumency. That if one
    were to focus hard enough, one could even Occlude from themselves. It was beneficial
    when under a considerable amount of stress or plagued by heavy emotions, allowing
    the accomplished Occlumens a respite to concentrate on more pressing matters.
</p>
<p>The technique had taken Severus a great deal of time to perfect- and not before
    everything went to hell during the First War- but he finally managed it in the end.
    It served him well throughout his tutelage with Potter, and better still, the
    Second War when there was so much chaos and death looming all around. And barring
    his slight miscalculations while being forced to teach The Boy Wonder Occlumency in
    ‘96 , there had never been an issue with security. Severus locked it all away,
    continuing to amass thoughts and memories as time went on, and only ever retrieving
    information if it were absolutely necessary.
</p>
<p>And no one ever knew about it. Not even Albus.</p>
<p>Severus often wondered whether the old codger had ever mastered the technique himself,
    but judging by the rampant… <em>giddiness</em> the man was so fond of, he highly doubted it.
    Severus didn’t need to be a born Legilimens to see <em>that.</em>
</p>
<p>Yes. Severus was a natural with Legilimency, but not only that. He was a born Occlumens as
    well. It was something else that no one alive ever knew about him. It had always been
    assumed by those who'd observed his talents that he had studied these obscure branches of
    magic and taught himself, but it was not so.
</p>
<p>It was his mother.</p>
<p>Eileen taught him how to harness his abilities and hide them away from the world, just as
    she had learned to hide her own natural ability from her violent husband. She wasn’t
    accomplished in the art- having no magical education beyond Hogwarts with which to bolster
    her abilities- but she did for him what she could no longer do for herself.  Severus knew
    better than to allow anyone to find out- especially his father. His mother was all he had.
</p>
<p>When he was finally enrolled as a student himself and witnessed firsthand the incredible, and
    virtually unlimited power of magic at Hogwarts, he resented her for it. For hiding. For not
    using her magic to make Tobias regret he’d ever been born. She’d bloody well let him use her
    own wand, and her books, and even her cauldron to his hearts’ content at Spinners End, but she
    couldn’t be bothered to help herself?!
</p>
<p>His youthful inexperience had misplaced the blame on her
    shoulders for something he could not fully understand.
</p>
<p>But, as tumultuous as his relationship had been with his mother- the woman who had succumbed to a life
    of muggle-induced servitude- it pained Severus to know that he had failed her.
</p>
<p>His mind could not suppress the thoughts of <em>Them…</em></p>
<p>
    <em>
        Enough! You are here to collect potion  ingredients and forget your
        troubles for more than two seconds!
    </em>
</p>
<p>Severus had reached the edge of the Forest. It loomed over him, foreboding
    as  ever. Not nearly as foreboding as himself, but still treacherous if one
    were to  forget themselves.</p>
<p>
    The Drifting Violets were in perfect bloom, all the  petals the exact shade
    needed for Veritaserum and several other delicate  potions. Severus
    collected the required amount and headed towards the unicorn  run. Ah, yes.
    The Bleeding Bittersweet was indeed close to harvesting, their  fruit plump
    and deep scarlet. The berries had frost-fermented well this year.  If he was
    lucky, there would be enough to brew with for the Hospital Wing as  well as
    all the St Mungo’s orders until next May.
</p>
<p>
    Severus found himself in much better spirits by the time  he reached the
    castle once more. So much so that he was able to indulge in a  little
    fantasy involving the begging of Messrs Weasley. This one though was
    rather… <em>comical</em> compared to the previous wrath-induced bouts of
    oath-driven vengeance he normally prescribed to. And it included none other
    than the matriarch of the family herself, Molly Weasley, looking crosser
    than  Severus had ever witnessed before.
</p>
<p>
    At some point during the interlude, she’d shown up- and  taken over- just as
    he was about to start hexing the Duo. She’d shouted the  place down- using
    quite colourful language the likes of which Severus had never  heard from
    her before- then forced both her sons to do manual labour for the  next
    hundred years. The last part of his wicked little fantasy had the Twits
    down on the floor of the Great Hall, scrubbing with their toothbrushes, and
    Molly yelling that it was never clean enough. Their long, white beards- the
    image possibly supplied by the incident they suffered from the Age Line in
    ’94-  swished back and forth as they shook their heads and groaned, swearing
    they’d  never pull pranks again.
</p>
<p>
    Severus snorted. Normally, this would have been an  unheard-of sound coming
    from him. He must have been in even higher spirits than  he first realized
    to have conjured up a thing like that.
</p>
<p>Severus paused a  moment, realizing for the first time that he had a weapon in his
    arsenal  against the Twits that no one else could disable. Molly Weasley…</p>
<p>
    No.
</p>
<p>
    No, Severus needed to handle this on his own, no matter  how tempted he was
    to see her take down her miscreant children. But… after he  was finished
    with them… perhaps he could let slip their ill-treatment of him. In
    Slytherin fashion, of course. Severus chuckled darkly at that. Oh, he
    couldn’t  wait to get back inside and see those Weasley faces when they
    caught the  feverish glint in his eyes. They’d be on edge for days, weeks,
    maybe even  months before he struck.
</p>
<p>
    Severus had reached the top of the steps before the  double-doored Entrance
    Hall. A lofty breeze caught against his long black hair,  gently swirling it
    into his face, and carrying with it the intoxicating scent  of Wandering
    Crab Apple blossoms. Severus inhaled deeply, holding the scent for  as long
    as he could before releasing it, sighing contentedly as he did so. He
    hadn’t felt this good in days.
</p>
<p>
    If only things could have stayed that way…
</p>
<p>
    It started like a distant hum approaching slowly from  behind. Then all too
    quickly it grew into what could only be described as the buzzing  of a
    thousand insects close at hand. Before Severus had the chance to turn, let
    alone raise his wand, they were upon him.
</p>
<p>
    PIXIES!!!
</p>
<p>
    PIXIES EVERYWHERE!!!
</p>
<p>
    A phalanx of miniature winged devils rapidly swirling all  around him like a
    tempest full of electric blue candy floss!!! Their sadistic  little shrieks
    and high-pitched cackling bombarding his ears! Their tiny,  clawed fingers
    catching against his robes! Their grubby paws searching out his skin,
    shuffling themselves underneath his clothes!
</p>
<p>
    Down through his high collar-
</p>
<p>
    <em>Bloody!</em>
</p>
<p>
    In through his shirt sleeves-
</p>
<p>
    <em>Fucking!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Up through his trouser legs-
</p>
<p>
    <em>Hell!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Finding themselves in the most undignified of places-
</p>
<p>
    <em>ARGH!!!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Severus continued to shout, but his protests were lost  under the heavy
    vibration of countless wings and shrill, devious laughter. The  air was
    filled with their taunts and obscenities and what sounded suspiciously  like
    raspberries- or he hoped that’s what it was anyway. There wasn’t any room
    in his mind for speculation now. Severus couldn’t even get his shields up to
    adequately protect himself in that moment. Harrowing, unrelenting,
    uncontrollable.  It was the most perplexing experience of his life. And he’d
    survived Tom  Riddle! Twice!
</p>
<p>
    Then suddenly, it was gone…
</p>
<p>
    All of it.
</p>
<p>
    No laughter, no buzzing. No pixies to be seen anywhere,  except for the
    glittering trail of Dust following in their wake as they flew  off
    collectively towards the Quad.
</p>
<p>
    The entire ordeal was over in less than a minute, and  Severus could do
    nothing but stand rigidly, his breath coming in irregular  little huffs, as
    he tried to process what had just transpired. Something which  disquieted
    him greatly. He wasn’t used to playing catch-up with his mind.
</p>
<p>
    With his breathing under control once more, and his  shields locked firmly
    into place again, Severus began to puzzle out the recent  onslaught of his
    person. And the very first thing he noticed, was the smell…
</p>
<p>
    Or lack thereof.
</p>
<p>
    Because it was gone.
</p>
<p>
    Both the primrose and dragon dung odors were completely  gone!
</p>
<p>
    A multitude of thought sped through his mind at this  revelation. How was
    this possible? Had the pixies anything to do with it? Of  course they did!
    The wretched stench wouldn’t just evaporate into thin air! But  how did they
    accomplish it? Was there some sort of magic they possessed that  was
    previously unheard of? Were they capable of more than this? Did their
    abilities extend to removing the shimmering sheen from his body as well?
</p>
<p>
    Severus found himself giddy with anticipation, a light  tremor breaking out
    across his body as he brought his hand before his face to  inspect-
</p>
<p>
    <em>GAH!!!</em>
</p>
<p>
    He recoiled in horror at what he saw. It wasn’t possible.  It just couldn’t
    be… But yes, of course it was. He was Severus Snape after all,  and the
    universe utterly loathed him.
    <em>
        Why didn’t the Dark Lord just kill  me!
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    In place of the sheen, there was the unmistakable,  undeniable and utterly
    verifiable sparkle of Pixie Dust. The electric blue  luster was coating
    every pore on his hand, and Severus knew even without  looking that it would
    be adhered to every millimeter of his accosted skin. He  also knew that
    nothing would remove such an exorbitant amount of Dust except  for a hard
    scrub with his most abrasive potions. And worse still, he knew deep  down
    that it wasn’t going to come off at all. It was yet another hostage of the
    treacle-sheen, which was not gone, but merely hidden by the Dust.
    <em>
        Wonderful.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Severus looked at his robes next. They too were covered  in Dust. The
    house-elves would have their work cut out for them again. He tried  brushing
    some of it from his sleeves. It sloughed off it a thick glittery layer  and
    cascaded downward, some of it landing on the stone steps, some of it
    traveling on the breeze away from him.
</p>
<p>
    <em>What a fucking mess.</em>
</p>
<p>
    His only consolation was that he no longer smelled bad.  He could not even
    pretend to be ungrateful for that. Severus pondered again at  the ability of
    the pixies to remove it from him. It was certainly a mystery. He  would need
    to research it further when he had more time.
</p>
<p>
    A gust caught his robes then, sending a cloud of sparkles  into the air.
    There was so much of it! There <em>shouldn’t</em> have been so  much. In
    fact, there shouldn’t have been so many pixies to begin with. And unless  he
    was mistaken- Severus knew he wasn’t- this was not a random gathering, but
    the  congregation of an entire Swarm.
</p>
<p>
    But… That wasn’t possible. The only time pixies ever gave  off so much
    effluvium was through their molting cycle, directly prior to their  annual
    mating. Which was <em>always</em> high summer. It was far too early for
    Pixie Season to begin.
</p>
<p>
    Severus was absolutely flummoxed. He pondered this for  several moments,
    forgetting that he was standing still as a statue on the  threshold of the
    Entrance Hall where anyone could see him. The only thing he  could think of
    that might cause this to happen would be if they were agitated  into such a
    state by an external force. Something that no witch or wizard in  their
    right mind would ever dare to…
</p>
<p>
    Realization shot through him so sharply that visible  sparks flew from the
    tips of his fingers.
</p>
<p>
    <em>WEASLEYS!!!</em>
</p>
<p>
    RAGE… NO WORDS… TOO FAR!!!
</p>
<p>
    Severus blew open the Entrance Hall doors by mere thought  alone- not an
    easy feat, as they were taller than a giant and twice as heavy.  The ancient
    panels on their hinges went banging into the stone, creaking and  groaning
    as they rebounded shakily. Sparkly blue motes swelled in the air around
    him, only now and again being dispersed by his dramatic huffing breaths.
</p>
<p>
    Severus had lost his shields entirely, his mind  freefalling through an
    all-consuming anger that he had not known since he was a  bullied teenager.
    Thoughts blinded by feelings. Only one thing mattered now.  Find them! Crush
    them! They must know your pain! They must feel it tenfold!
</p>
<p>
    He stormed over the threshold and through the Entrance  Hall. Each murderous
    step shaking loose even more damned Dust as he went. And  slowly, ever so
    slowly, his mind came back to him. Severus halted midstride.  He’d gone
    halfway up the stairs to the First Floor when he realized those  impudent
    little shits wouldn’t be in their quarters.
    <em>
        Argh! The bloody  fucking meeting!
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Severus turned sharply and flew- literally- back down the  stairs, landing
    harder than he meant to on the entryway of the Ground Floor. Even  more Dust
    was jarred loose then, leaving a glittering ribbon behind him in his
    wrathful pursuit. Multiple students witnessed this and froze where they
    stood, eyes  wide in awesome terror. Their Potions Master quickly waded
    through them, ignoring  their trepidation, his stride lengthening with each
    fiery step. Those further  along in the corridor, realizing his intent to
    thunder their way, leapt to  either side and ducked for cover. Never in all
    their years, even in their worst  nightmares, had they ever seen the
    maelstrom of an enraged, sparkling, electric  blue Professor Snape.
</p>
<p>
    He arrived at the Staffroom just in time and burst  through the door, the
    resounding BANG against the office wall even louder than  its Entrance Hall
    counterpart. His colleagues jumped from the disturbance, some  of them
    shrieking in surprise. Albus looked up at him without moving from his
    chair, his calm exterior belying first the shock of such a display and then
    his  perturbance at what had caused it.
</p>
<p>
    Severus looked about in haste, wanting to single out his  prey quickly
    before anyone had a chance to draw their wand against him. A  fleeting
    thought went to Albus, his ability to disarm was legendary after all. That
    would be tricky. But Severus only needed a few seconds to fire off a spell
    though.  He might be able to pull it off. If he were lucky. Which he already
    knew wasn’t  possible with the learned, ancient man in the room.
    <em>
        Damn it all!
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Of course, none of it mattered in the end. As Severus  finished scanning the
    room, he found it lacking the two identical redheads he’d  been in search
    of. <em>ARGH!</em>
</p>
<p>
    He entered the room, barely containing his rage as he  slammed the door
    behind him with another wood-splintering BANG. The others shuffled  their
    chairs back quickly, mouths hanging open at his appearance, allowing him  to
    stride through the middle of the room unimpeded. He stood before the
    Headmaster, his breathing sporadic, not bothering to hide the murderous
    intent  playing across his features.
</p>
<p>
    “Severus?” Albus queried, his tone cautious. He appeared  to be at a loss
    for words at the sight of him.
</p>
<p>
    “<em>Where. Are. They?</em>” Severus ground out in his  lowest, most deadly
    snarl.
</p>
<p>
    “Who?” Albus steepled his fingers together. To the  average observer, this
    would look innocent enough, but to the practiced eye,  they would know that
    his fingers were brushing the tip of his wand hidden  beneath.
</p>
<p>
    “WEASLEYS!!!” Severus bellowed. The rest of the staff  cringed and fell back
    further, all except Minerva, who merely looked peeved at  him, just as she
    always did when he showed any disrespect towards the old man.
</p>
<p>
    “Severus, you can’t seriously think that-”
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t!” Severus was truly about to come apart at the  seams this time.
    “You’re always defending them! Your <em>precious little Gryffindors!</em>
    Well, this is the result! Look at what they’ve done this  time!”
</p>
<p>
    “Ah. You appear to be… sparkling.” Albus suggested  gently.
</p>
<p>
    “Indeed! They set a fucking Swarm of pixies on me!”
</p>
<p>
    “A-a Swarm?” Pomona spoke timidly. “But that can’t be  right, Severus. It-
    it isn’t Pixie Season yet.”
</p>
<p>
    “Anyone with half a brain knows that!” Severus fumed,  staring down the
    short, plump woman before turning his wrath back on Albus once  more. “So,
    obviously, there can be only one other logical conclusion!”
</p>
<p>
    Albus sighed. “Did you see Fred and George set them loose  on you?”
</p>
<p>
    “No!”
</p>
<p>
    “Then I’m afraid that once again I have no evidence in  your favor, my boy.”
</p>
<p>
    “You know they did it! Just like the dung, and the syrup,  and sticking me
    to my chair, and those gods-awful flowers!”
</p>
<p>
    Filius sat the closest to him and flinched back even  further, most likely
    terrified of being crushed at some point.
</p>
<p>
    “Yes. We’ve already discussed the flowers, but the rest-”
</p>
<p>
    “When I get my hands on them Albus, I will make them wish  they had never
    been born!”
</p>
<p>
    “Severus.”
</p>
<p>
    “I will do it slowly; I will make them beg!”
</p>
<p>
    “Severus.”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, they will beg. But I will not relent until I have  them strung up by
    their-”
</p>
<p>
    “SEVERUS!” Albus shouted. Everyone froze. Time itself  stood still.
</p>
<p>
    The Headmaster’s voice continued to reverberated  throughout the room, the
    echo growing fainter with each moment, but no less  dangerous. Severus was
    stunned into silence, remembering himself at last and  regretting his
    petulant outburst immediately. The look Albus gave him held more  irritation
    than anger though. Perhaps he hadn’t fucked things up so badly after  all.
</p>
<p>
    “Severus,” Albus began, using the tone he normally  reserved for misbehaving
    children. “I will allow you these latest outbursts  because you have been so
    put upon recently, but no more. The matter pertaining  to your abuse will be
    dealt with as soon as this meeting is concluded. In the  meantime, you will
    listen to me <em>carefully</em>.”  He paused, his gaze never wavering from
    the  wrathful Potions Master. “Fred and George have already been punished
    for their  little joke on Friday. Part of that punishment is a temporary
    suspension from  their positions within this school. The suspension has been
    in effect since  Friday afternoon. That was two days ago. <em>Before</em>
    all these other misdeeds  befell you. I will agree with you that it is possible
    for them to be involved somehow,  though I find it highly unlikely they are
    the cause of all your current issues.  However, if you are correct, if they
    are fully responsible, Fred and George will  be sacked immediately.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus gaped at this admission.
</p>
<p>
    “However, if they are not guilty of these transgressions,  you will stop all
    such accusations against them. In future, should any further  damage occur
    to you, you will address me with your concerns, and no one else.  Then we
    shall rectify the situation together. You will refrain from seeking out
    Fred and George and attempting to tarnish their good names or cause them
    bodily  harm of any kind.” Albus continued to hold his gaze, letting the
    silence  stretch out between them for what felt like ages.
</p>
<p>
    “Now,” the Headmaster said lightheartedly, changing  topics in the blink of
    an eye, “as to all this Pixie Dust business, I believe I  may have an expert
    readily available to help you.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus felt relief and suspicion rushing though him  simultaneously.
    Sacking the Weasleys and removing these damnable sparkles on  the same day?
    It was too good to be true.
</p>
<p>
    “In fact,” Albus continued, “There is someone on the  premises at this very
    moment who should be able to assist you.”
</p>
<p>
    “Who?” Severus didn’t like the way Albus’ eyes were  twinkling.
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, just an old friend I had lunch with this afternoon.  I’ll go and fetch
    him, now.” Albus stood and walked to the fireplace, threw in  a handful of
    Floo powder and announced his destination, “Hagrid’s Hut.” Then he  was gone
    in a burst of green flames.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Hagrid? Surely not.</em>
    <em>
        Well,  on the other hand, he does deal with magical creatures… ‘Deal
        with them’, as in  mucking up everyone else’s lives and injuring both
        staff and students.
    </em>
    Before Severus could ponder further at this bizarre turn of events Albus
    reappeared through the Floo with-
</p>
<p>
    “<em>Lupin!</em>”
</p>
<p>
    “Good afternoon, Severus.” Remus said hesitantly, his  soft eyes going round
    in that moment. He quickly schooled his features though,  trying to act as
    if an electric-blue-lustered person was something he saw every  day.
</p>
<p>
    “What is <em>he</em> doing here?!” Severus snarled at  Albus.
</p>
<p>
    “I’ve already explained that to you, my boy. We had lunch  today and then
    Remus decided to visit Rubeus for the afternoon. Where is he, by  the way?”
    Albus directed his question at the once DADA professor.
</p>
<p>
    “Funny, that.” Remus chuckled. “We were chatting, and he  was about to offer
    me some rock cakes, when a strange look came over him. He  mumbled something
    that I couldn’t quite hear and ran off with a quick apology.  I thought
    perhaps he’d be here for your staff meeting.”
</p>
<p>
    “Hmm…” Albus thought. “No, he’s been absent the entire  time. Well, never
    mind. You’re here now, Remus, and that’s what’s truly  important.”
</p>
<p>
    Remus looked at him curiously.
</p>
<p>
    “Severus has, as I’m sure you’ve noticed by now, happened  upon a slight
    problem. I thought that perhaps you might be able to undo  whatever has
    befallen him of late. Didn’t you keep pixies in your classroom  when you
    were employed at Hogwarts?”
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, no. I had a grindylow. I believe that was Lockhart  who felt the need
    to unleash- ah, exhibit pixies for his second-year students.”
</p>
<p>
    “Of course, yes, now I remember.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus was glaring daggers at both of them.
</p>
<p>
    Remus cleared his throat. “While I appreciate your  generous compliments,
    Albus, perhaps Hagrid would be better suited to finding a  solution to this
    little problem.” He was trying not to look at Severus, knowing  the man
    hated being displayed like this for the entire staff to see and clearly
    hated being near him as well.
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, well, Hagrid isn’t here, and you are. I know you  can figure something
    out.”
</p>
<p>
    Remus cleared his throat again. “I-I will certainly try.  That is, if
    Severus is amenable to it.”
</p>
<p>
    “Bugger off!” Severus shouted at Lupin, and then  practically screamed at
    Albus. “How dare you invite him here like this! I know  what your little
    game is, and you will not trap me in it!”
</p>
<p>
    “Severus, I meant nothing by it other than to help you-”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, yes. You’re always ‘helping’ people, aren’t you?”  Severus growled.
</p>
<p>
    “My boy-”
</p>
<p>
    “I have been present and accounted for, have I not?”  Severus snipped. Albus
    sighed then nodded. “So, you can just go ahead and tick  that off your
    little probation list for the month.” he spat. “I am going back to my lab now
    and staying there until I discover a way to remove this insidious  glitter!”
    He glared at them all in turn and stormed out with another blue  ribbon of
    Dust trailing behind.
</p>
<p>
    Albus sighed again. “I am sorry, Remus. I thought for  sure he would at
    least be civil towards you. But he’s had quite a bit on his  mind lately.”
    He stared at Remus briefly before continuing. “I will try to  convince him
    to let you help, but for now, it might be best if you left him be.”  Remus
    nodded in agreement. “Might I ask just one more small favour of you?”
</p>
<p>
    “Of course, Albus, anything.”
</p>
<p>
    “Would you be so kind as to track down our elusive  gamekeeper this
    afternoon? It makes me uneasy knowing that he should be so capricious.”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, sir.” Remus nodded, then bid farewell to the others  and went in
    search of Hagrid.
</p>
<p>
    Albus turned to the rest of the staff, who hadn’t dared  to do more than
    breathe throughout the entire exchange. “I believe it would be  best for all
    of us to reconvene our meeting after the students have departed  for their
    holidays. Let’s say… Tuesday next, at 3 pm?” They nodded, albeit  rather
    numbly. “Right. Off you pop, then.” Albus raised his hand to the door. His
    employees began to file out one by one.
</p>
<p>
    “Except,” Albus called commandingly. “Pomona, Filius and  Bathsheda. I
    believe there is something else you can assist me with today.”
</p>
<p>
    Nervously, the Herbology, Charms, and Ancient Runes  professors approached
    Albus.
</p>
<p>
    He waited until those that had been dismissed left with  the door shut
    behind them, then gave each of the remaining teachers a severe  look. They
    flinched and fidgeted under his gaze. “I would like to offer each of  you
    the opportunity to confess any misdeeds you might have unleashed against
    Severus. If you are not guilty of such a thing, you may leave now. If,
    however,  you are guilty and you leave without informing me, there will be
    <em>serious  consequences</em>.”
</p>
<p>
    The three professors looked at one another then, their  faces contorting
    with a myriad of emotion. Confusion. Realisation.  Bewilderment. Anxiety.
    The last of these had Babbling bursting forth to speak.  “I didn’t mean
    anything bad by it!” There was a slight tremor in her voice.
</p>
<p>
    Albus looked at her, his demeanor calm. “What happened?  From the beginning,
    if you please.”
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t mind Severus being snarky- that’s nothing new-  but he has been
    increasingly snippy with me, and I can only take so much of  it!” Bathsheda
    paused to take a deep breath. “Friday was the last straw. I only  wanted to
    get back at him for being so vile over breakfast…” Then in a smaller,
    somewhat petulant voice, “… just thought maybe he’d enjoy a bit of treacle
    in  place of his coffee.” She looked down at her toes.
</p>
<p>
    “How did you accomplish such a thing? I cannot image that  Severus would
    take no notice of you adding it to his cup.” Albus asked calmy.
</p>
<p>
    Bathsheda forced herself to look up at the Headmaster.  “Runes… Just simple
    runes and a basic bit of transfiguration- spelled to the  bottom of his cup
    yesterday morning- so his coffee would transform when he was  about to drink
    it. I- I don’t understand how it got all over him. It shouldn’t  have done
    that!” She finished, looking rather miserable.
</p>
<p>
    “Hmm…” Albus mused. “And you, Pomona?”
</p>
<p>
    Sprout twisted her fingers together and grimaced. “I  thought it only fair
    to repay Severus for his brash behaviour Friday afternoon.  I don’t mind the
    fat jokes, you know. I’d be the first to tell you I’m well  rotund. But he
    was just so volatile! And I- well, I just can’t abide such  rudeness.” She
    huffed, then looked anxiously at Albus. “I swear to you, if I  had known
    there was a Swarm of pixies about, I <em>never</em> would have used  fresh
    dragon dung.” Pomona shook her head. “It makes no sense, Albus. It’s not
    Pixie Season.”
</p>
<p>
    Albus hummed again, forebodingly. “And you, Filius?” He  eyed the tiny man
    severely.
</p>
<p>
    Flitwick squeaked and started. “I, well… It was just a  simple sticking
    charm. It was only meant to keep him for a moment. I didn’t  mean any real
    harm, honestly.” He looked quite worried. “I can’t understand why  he would
    have been stuck fast like that…”
</p>
<p>
    “And what prompted you to take such an action against  Severus?”
</p>
<p>
    Filius fidgeted. “When he yelled at Pomona and me in the  Staffroom
    Friday afternoon… We were trying to be nice and offer him a cup of  tea, and
    he…. he… He ate all the Bourbon biscuits!” Filius looked up stormily,  his
    little chest puffed out. “I don’t normally give a fig about his prickly
    behavior Albus, but that was just too much to bear!” Then in a much calmer
    and  quieter voice, barely above a whisper he muttered “they’re <em>my</em>
    favourite,  too.”
</p>
<p>
    “I see.” Albus said pensively. He turned his back to them  and contemplated
    their earnest confessions, humming occasionally as he  unraveled each thread
    of the mystery woven before him. A thought occurred to  him then and he
    strode to the fireplace at once. He took a pinch of Floo powder  and threw
    it into the hearth. Green flames leapt up, eagerly awaiting his  verbal
    command, but instead of calling out a destination, Albus made a  complicated
    set of movements with his hands that the watching professors could  not
    decipher. He stepped into the fireplace, and a moment later he was gone.
</p>
<p>
    The three perplexed teachers stood there not knowing what  to do but dared
    not go without Albus giving them leave. They jumped at the  sudden
    reappearance of their Headmaster and two familiar red-headed staff  members
    in tow.
</p>
<p>
    “Alright, Albus. What exactly did you need to spirit us  away for, then?”
    Fred asked, brushing a bit of soot from the top of his sibling’s  head.
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah, we were in the middle of something <em>important</em>.”  George
    raised his brow at the Headmaster, before flicking some ash from his
    brother’s shoulder in kind.
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, I know. And you are making good progress, so I  won’t keep you.” Albus
    responded sternly.
</p>
<p>
    The other teachers watched them, confusion painting their  faces at the
    cryptic exchange.
</p>
<p>
    “Now,” Albus continued. “I must ask you about that bit of  spell work you
    performed on Severus’ quarters Friday morning. What exactly was  this
    ‘experiment’ of yours, and how did you apply it? Be as specific as you  can,
    please.”
</p>
<p>
    The twins looked at each other impishly, then sprang  forward into a grand
    pose. “Flashy Flora!” they announced together, rippling  their hands outward
    in synchrony. “Blooms of Fun for Everyone!”
</p>
<p>
    “We hope to get the finished product in the shop by  summer break.” Fred
    supplied, excitedly.
</p>
<p>
    “But we’ll make sure all the issues are resolved before  marketing it to the
    public.” George reassured the pensive old man, hoping they  hadn’t somehow
    gotten themselves into further trouble. “And we’ve already  decided on a
    single-use pellet. The spell will activate upon contact with a  solid
    surface, but only when sudden force is applied to it <em>and</em> the
    incantation <em>Fulgeo</em> is spoken, so it won’t accidentally go off in
    someone’s trouser pocket or satchel.”
</p>
<p>
    Albus gazed at them intently.
</p>
<p>
    George cleared his throat, unease settling on him at the  Headmaster’s
    penetrative stare. ‘There’s um… there’s nothing to it, really.” He  rubbed
    the back of his neck awkwardly.
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah, just a couple of simple spells.” Fred added  cautiously.
</p>
<p>
    “What sort of spells?” Albus asked calmly.
</p>
<p>
    “<em>Flore</em>.” Fred answered. “Obviously, we needed that  one to make the
    bouquet on Snape’s desk.”
</p>
<p>
    “But we quickly realized how long it would take to fill  his entire sitting
    room in the same way, so we came up with a compound spell to  speed up the
    process.” George added.
</p>
<p>
    “What exactly did you use to create ‘Flashy Flora’?”  Albus asked just as
    calmy.
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, a little of this, a little of that.” Fred canted his  head from side to
    side, emphasizing his point.
</p>
<p>
    Albus regarded him severely over his half-moon specs.
</p>
<p>
    George, seeing the fierceness in the aged Headmaster’s eyes,  chimed in
    quickly. “We used <em>Flore</em>, <em>Abundare</em> and <em>Maxima</em>.
    Like we said, it was just a couple of simple spells.” Then, rather
    nervously, “It-it  is a rather lovely display…”, unsure if it would lessen
    Albus’ irritation.
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah, one elegant flourish and boom! Whatever space  you’re in… ‘elegantly
    flourishes’. <em>Flore-Abundare Maxima</em>!” Fred grinned,  demonstrating
    his point with a wave of his hand around the room. But only for a  moment as
    Albus had turned to regard him even more severely.
</p>
<p>
    Albus observed the pair silently for a moment, then  hummed. “And those were
    the only spells you used?” he questioned skeptically.  He turned his back to
    them, looking out the window towards the Lake.
</p>
<p>
    George cleared his throat again. “Well, technically… yes.  But we had a
    slight problem with the wrist movement from <em>Abundare</em>, it  just
    wouldn’t mesh with the twist from <em>Flore</em>, so we adjusted it with the
    drag from <em>Geminio</em> and it worked perfectly.”
</p>
<p>
    “Ah.” Albus replied knowingly, a small smile that they  could not see
    curling his lip.
</p>
<p>
    George was suddenly reminded of the snapdragons in the  Headmaster’s toilet.
    “Well, almost perfectly. I mean, we each tried it a dozen  times on our own
    quarters before using it on Snape’s. We didn’t have any  problems then. I
    can’t imagine how any of it got through the Floo.”
</p>
<p>
    Albus was silent for several moments, his staff watching  him intently. He
    nodded and hummed as he paced back and forth in front of the  hearth. At
    last, he asked, “Which of you cast the spell?”
</p>
<p>
    “I cast the <em>Flore</em> for Snape’s bouquet.” George  answered
    cautiously, confused as to why it mattered.
</p>
<p>
    “A-and I cast Flashy Flora on his sitting room.” Fred  supplied, equally
    confused.
</p>
<p>
    “And did either of you cast <em>Finite</em> afterwards?”
</p>
<p>
    The twins looked perplexedly at each other- identical  furrows on their
    brows- then back at Albus. “No.” they said in unison.
</p>
<p>
    “Exactly.” The wise Headmaster turned to them once more,  taking in the
    confused faces of all five members of his staff as he did so. A  calculating
    light shone in his eyes as he addressed Fred and George again. “When  I
    spoke with you Friday morning, it was agreed that you would both begin your
    temporary suspension as well as your <em>New</em> <em>Assignment</em>
    immediately.  And you did. Which would explain why traces of your
    experimental spell remained  in the room even after Severus cleared away
    your ‘thoughtful decorations’.” He  did not tell them about the floral odor,
    however, wanting to preserve at least  a small amount of the poor man’s
    dignity. “Oh, and by the way boys, <em>Abundas</em> would have been less
    likely to cause an <em>overflow</em> into my own quarters.”  He stared
    severely over his specs once more.
</p>
<p>
    They both looked at him in confusion before George voiced  their mutual
    concern. “Why would we need to cast <em>Finite</em>? I mean,  whatever Snape
    did to get rid of the flowers would have been enough… wouldn’t  it?”
    Neither one of them felt quite certain anymore.
</p>
<p>
    “You used elements from <em>Geminio</em> to bind your spell,  only a
    syllable away from <em>Gemino</em>. Surely, you know the dangers of that
    curse  and that all actions regarding it must be completed by the person who
    originally cast it?”
</p>
<p>
    Fred threw his hands out before him, shaking his head and  looking aghast.
    “Whoa! We never meant to use the curse!”
</p>
<p>
    “And you didn’t.” Albus assured the terrified looking  youth. “Otherwise,
    things would still be doubling like mad, wouldn’t they?”  Both young men
    opened their mouths to speak at the same time, but Albus stayed  their words
    with a raised hand. “But nevertheless, the foundation of both  spells
    ensures the duplication of tangible objects, correct?” They nodded in
    agreement, and he continued. “Therefore, when <em>Geminio</em> is applied to
    other <em>spells</em> rather than <em>tangible objects</em>, unforeseen
    complications might occur. I believe the two of you have helped to create
    something far greater than you realize.”
</p>
<p>
    “What?!” They asked in bewilderment.
</p>
<p>
    “Severus is a very powerful wizard, one of the most  brilliant I have ever
    known. I would imagine that his method of removal  concerning your ‘gift’,
    would have involved a rather <em>explosive</em> amount of  magic. Much like
    the accidental outbursts of a young witch or wizard, I think. Something
    volatile enough that it would have merged with your own temperamental
    spellwork.”
</p>
<p>
    “Um, Albus.” George began, anxious and still terribly  confused. “What
    exactly does that mean?”
</p>
<p>
    “<em>Geminio</em>, <em>Abundare</em>, and <em>Maxima</em> are  all types of
    enhancement spells, and potent incantation when performed  correctly with
    great intent. I believe that your experimental charm was not  only infused
    with elements from each but compounded and perpetuated absolutely  by them.
    In essence, you created what could be called an Infinity charm. Something
    that lasts indefinitely unless you cast <em>Finite</em> to break the spell.”
</p>
<p>
    Fred and George simply stared at Albus with eyes wide and  mouths agape,
    shock and awe overwhelming their features. Then, slowly, identical  grins
    spread across their impish faces. “Wicked!”
</p>
<p>
    The wise Headmaster interrupted their newfound enthusiasm  with another
    severe stare. “This is a serious issue, boys.” His dark tone left  no room
    for interpretation. “You could have killed someone, caused them  irreparable
    harm, or at the very least left them injured in the Hospital wing  for
    days.”
</p>
<p>
    “Albus! We’d never let that happen!” Fred exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah, we <em>always</em> test our products thoroughly  before setting them
    loose on other people.” George added.
</p>
<p>
    “I believe you, boys, but the fact remains that it is  still at a dangerous
    stage of development- something you might never have been  made aware of if
    not for Severus’ powerful contribution. And therefore, I must  forbid you
    from ‘experimenting’ further while you are within the Grounds of  Hogwarts.”
</p>
<p>
    The twins looked utterly crestfallen.
</p>
<p>
    “However,” Albus continued, his tone something akin to  lighthearted, “you
    may do as you please anywhere else. I will not hinder you,  but I will
    caution you against any frivolity in your venture. And you must  address the
    Ministry with your findings when you have completed your research.
    Otherwise, I highly doubt they will allow you to patent your final product.”
</p>
<p>
    The twins’ eyes were alight with mirth at the  Headmaster’s blessing, their
    impish grins returning tenfold.
</p>
<p>
    “So, now that that’s settled, we must deal with the  status of your
    employment.” Albus addressed the two youngest members of his  staff, his
    reprimanding gaze freezing them in place. “Your Infinity charm has
    compromised one of my professors. It was unintentional, so I cannot legally
    have you sacked-” Fred and George began to protest, but Albus held them off
    once again with a raised hand. “Nor would I want to.” He reassured them.
    “You  are by far some of the best teachers that Hogwarts has ever seen, <em>
    and</em> you have helped to break Riddle’s curse on the DADA position. I am
    immeasurably  grateful to both of you for that.” The twins’ smiles grew, if
    possible, even  wider at this declaration. “But,” Albus concluded, his tone
    severe once more,  his eyes never leaving the two pranksters, “I must have
    this whole fiasco  cleaned up, and promptly.”
</p>
<p>
    Albus let the silence fall around them for a moment  longer before turning
    towards the other staff members. “That is where  Bathsheda, Pomona, and
    Filius come into the picture.” He gave them a sharp  glance. “You see, they
    decided to take it upon themselves to enact a little  revenge upon Severus
    for his recent string of slights against them.”
</p>
<p>
    The three accused professors stammered and Albus held up  his hand to
    silence them as well. “And,” he looked at the twins once more, “your spell
    was still active when Severus took his place at the High Table Saturday
    morning. He sat at his usual chair, which Filius had infused with a sticking
    charm.”
</p>
<p>
    Flitwick blustered, all the while Fred and George gaped  at him, shocked
    that he would do such a thing to the dangerous Potions Master.  Albus raised
    his hand to keep them silent.
</p>
<p>
    “Then,” Abus spoke over the fussing Charms teacher, “Severus  retrieved his
    usual mug, which Bathsheda had inscribed with runes on the bottom,  to
    transfigure his coffee into treacle.”
</p>
<p>
    Babbling made a whining noise in the back of her throat  and looked at the
    floor while the twins stared at her in awe.
</p>
<p>
    “And Pomona,” the Headmaster cut her off before she could  stammer out
    another apology, “left fresh dragon dung at the hidden entrance to his office,
    which Severus discovered only too late, and quite literally put his foot in.”
</p>
<p>
    Fred and George couldn’t help but snigger.
</p>
<p>
    Albus glared at them, and they fell silent once more. He  surveyed each
    member of his staff then, assuring himself there would be no more  outbursts
    before continuing. “Severus has been under an exorbitant amount of  stress
    lately, much of which derives from his forced imprisonment within this
    school- as you well know.” The teachers all nodded in agreement, the stony
    glint in their eyes reserved for the Ministry and their maltreatment of the
    great War Hero. They’d been appalled when his sentence was handed down.
</p>
<p>
    “I believe”, Albus supplied, “that when his explosive  magic intertwined
    with your Infinity charm, not only did it become highly  unstable and leave
    traces behind, but those traces joined with the most viable  object in the
    room. Severus himself.”
</p>
<p>
    The twins both made an identical ‘O’ with their mouths.  “So…” Fred began,
    “What your saying is that Snape is some sort of striding,  snarling Infinity
    charm?”
</p>
<p>
    “Basically.” Albus inclined his head slightly, peering  over his half-moon
    specs at them. “As I have said, the effects of your charm  were diminished,
    but the essence was still present. So, Severus is not fully  capable of
    perpetuating anything. But it seems as if the charm is exacerbating
    everything else that he comes in contact with.”
</p>
<p>
    The twins’ eyes were wide but thoughtful. Albus could  practically see the
    gears turning in their heads filled with rampant  possibility. “So, when
    Severus sat in his chair during breakfast, and the  sticking charm that
    Filius applied was activated, your Infinity charm absorbed  the properties
    of that spell. And when the transfigured treacle- thanks to  Bathsheda- in
    Severus’ mug touched his lip, your Infinity charm absorbed those  properties
    as well. I imagine that is why he became covered in syrup, and it  would not
    come off again no matter how hard he tried. Then, of course, when he
    stepped in the dragon dung that Pomona left for him, which must have been
    held  under a stasis charm to preserve it, well…”
</p>
<p>
    “I never would have done such a thing if I’d known he’d  suffer like that,
    Albus! You must believe me!” Sprout intimated, her fly away  hair swaying as
    she shook her head.
</p>
<p>
    “I do believe you, my dear.” Then the Headmaster sighed  and shook his head,
    looking about the room for a moment lost in thought. At  last he spoke,
    though whether it was to his staff or into the aether, no one  knew.
    “Severus has been affected most egregiously by all of this… but the  pixies…
    I am truly at a loss.” Albus threw up his hands halfheartedly, then  focused
    on the anxious face of his Herbology teacher once more. “As you said,
    Pomona, it isn’t Pixie Season yet.” She shook her head briskly in agreement.
</p>
<p>
    “Well, that’s enough rumination for one day, I think.”  Albus said. “Let’s
    get to work, shall we?” The professors looked at him,  confusion and
    trepidation warring within their features. “George.” He addressed  with
    authority. “You were responsible for casting ‘Flashy Flora’, so I will  need you
    to run along and cast a <em>Finite</em> on Severus’ quarters as well. We
    will have no more unstable magic loose about his rooms.” Another harsh stare
    over his half-moon specs. “Oh, and mind how you go. If he catches you,
    you’re  liable to be damaged beyond repair.” he added.
</p>
<p>
    George nodded fervently.
</p>
<p>
    “Fred,” Albus commanded, “you will escort Bathsheda,  Filius, and Pomona
    back with you to your <em>Assignment</em>. They are very eager  to assist
    you in any way that they can after this debacle.” He looked at them severely
    and they heartily stammered their agreement.
</p>
<p>
    Albus formally concluded the private meeting and  dismissed his staff.
    However, as everyone was preparing to leave, the door flew  open and Hagrid
    burst into the room huffing and puffing. He took a moment to  collect
    himself- though still huffing and puffing terribly- staring confusedly  at
    the Pixie Dust on the floor, then looked back up at everyone before zoning
    in on the Headmaster. “Oh, good! You’re ‘ere!” He yelled exasperatedly; his
    breathing marginally less sporadic now. “Oh, Professor Dumbledore… I… oh,
    i’s  jus’ terrible. I don’ righ'ly know where teh begin.”
</p>
<p>
    Albus sighed and held up his hand. “Calm yourself,  Rubeus.” He waited a
    beat for his shaggy gamekeeper to get his breathing fully  under control,
    then added, “Now, explain the situation to me. One thing at a  time, if you
    please.”
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, well.” He cleared his throat. “Yeh see, I was… well.  I ‘ad this
    special treat planned for me third-year students.” He was twisting  his
    sausage-sized fingers in earnest, looking at his feet. “An’ it seems tha’…
    well… thin’s got a bit out o’ hand.”
</p>
<p>
    Albus looked intently at the bumbling half-giant, using  his last patience
    of the day to remain calm. “Go on.” He coaxed.
</p>
<p>
    “Righ', well… The thin’ is. I ‘ad a Colony o’ pixies  stashed away in the
    Forbidden Forest. Yeh know, somethin’ really grand for the  start o’ summer
    term. I wanted ter teach ‘em how the spot the diff’rences  before and after
    the little thin’s molt for their Swarm. Yeh know, teh keep 'em safe.”
</p>
<p>
    Albus knew this would not end well, but he entreated  Hagrid to continue
    anyway. “You have been keeping pixies in the Forest?”
</p>
<p>
    “Well, yeah. Hatched ‘em and everythin’ all by meself.”  He said proudly.
</p>
<p>
    “You hatched an entire Colony of pixies?” Albus couldn’t  entirely keep the
    surprise from his voice.
</p>
<p>
    Fred and George looked on in amazement but without  surprise. “Do you have
    any of the eggs left?” George asked eagerly.
</p>
<p>
    Albus gave them a hard stare. He gestured with his hand  for Hagrid to
    continue.
</p>
<p>
    “Ah,” Hagrid began nervously again, “well, it wouldn’ be a  proper lesson
    withou’ enough creatures ter go round for each student, would  it?” He asked
    confused.
</p>
<p>
    Albus nodded, measuring his response. “Of course not,  Rubeus. However,
    don’t you think it might have been better to choose a less  hazardous
    creature in such large numbers?”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, i‘s not tha’ many, really. About two ‘undred, is  all.”
</p>
<p>
    “Two hundred!” Fred exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah.” Hagrid beamed. “There’s Mupsy an’ Doplin an’ Egar  an’ Slimpy,” he
    began reciting their names, counting on his fingers.
</p>
<p>
    The twins had a time of it hiding their laughter. They  kept glancing at
    Albus, his posture growing more severe by the second, his face  showing
    clearly that he was at a loss for words as well as what to do about  this
    latest development. All the while, Hagrid continued naming each pixie from
    his precious Colony.
</p>
<p>
    “- Shawny, Mumu, Itsy, oh an’ yeh can’ forget Dippy. <em>No  one</em>‘ll
    forget ‘im in a hurry.” He leaned over to the twins  conspiratorially and
    added. “ee’s a righ' tricky one.” He glanced back at Albus  and noted the
    perplexed stare on his face. Mistaking it for disappointment, he  quickly
    added. “Oh, bu’ then there’s LuLu! She ‘as the most beau’iful scales.
    She’ll really be somethin’ when she ‘as her firs’ molt.”
</p>
<p>
    “That’s incredible, Hagrid!” George added, trying not to  lose it.
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, ‘twas easy enough.” The half-giant blushed.
</p>
<p>
    At that the twins couldn’t help but guffaw, holding their  middles and
    bracing themselves to keep each other upright.
</p>
<p>
    “That’s enough.” Albus directed his impatience at the  twins, who
    immediately fell silent but couldn’t help the involuntary grins that  kept
    spreading across their faces, no matter how hard they tried to tamp them
    down.
</p>
<p>
    “Now, Rubeus.” Albus began what felt like the one millionth  remonstrative
    speech about his disastrous escapades in husbandry. “I appreciate  that you
    felt the need to educate our students so thoroughly on the dangers of  Pixie
    Swarms, but I must ask you not to choose such a stressful category for  the
    third-year classes again.”
</p>
<p>
    “Bu’ they’re jus’ pixies. Totally ‘armless. Tha’s why I  chose ‘em. Didn’
    want nothin’ too dangerous for such youngins.”
</p>
<p>
    Albus released a long sigh. “I will agree that they are  usually nothing
    more than an irritant in small numbers, but a Swarm can be  unpredictable.
    It is something that should be taught <em>in theory only</em>,  until they
    are preparing for O.W.L.s, and would be even better suited for  N.E.W.T.s.”
    He gave Hagrid a severe look to drive his point home.
</p>
<p>
    “Oh. Righ'.” Hagrid looked down bashfully.
</p>
<p>
    Albus sighed again, already guessing the answer to the  question he was
    about to pose. “You said there was a problem with this Colony  of yours?”
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, yeah. Well…” He began twisting his fingers again. “I  was entertainin’
    Remus this afternoon when I noticed ‘em…” He paused, trying to  find the
    best way of telling Albus what had happened. “I looked ou’ the window  and
    saw ‘em takin’ off from the Forest. Professor Dumbledore… they aren’t teh
    start their Swarmin’ ‘til the kids are back from their break.” He hung his
    head  low shaking it from side to side. ‘I ‘ad it all planned ou’. I don’
    understand  what ‘appened…”
</p>
<p>
    Albus remained calm, dutifully assessing the situation.  “Where is the Swarm
    now?”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, they flew off t’wards the castle. Tha’s why I lef’  Remus in such a
    hurry… an’ I tried ter keep up with ‘em, bu’ they’re righ'  fast.” Hagrid
    spoke intently. “I followed their trail o’ Dust, though. Though’  for sure
    they’d go straight ter the greenhouses, since tha’d be the only place  teh
    find fresh dragon dung and they need it for their nests yeh know…” He
    trailed off, his brow furrowed in concentration. “Bu’ they shouldn’ve been
    able  ter smell it from so deep in the Forest. I made sure teh keep ‘em far
    enough  away, so they wouldn’ go off before it was time.”
</p>
<p>
    Albus stared at Hagrid curiously. “Regardless of whether  or not there was
    fresh dragon dung available, the pixies should not have  Swarmed. Their
    mating season does not begin for another two months.”
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, well… as to tha’… You’re righ' o’ course.” Hagrid  cleared his throat
    nervously. “Bu’ I, well… I migh’ve ‘elped ‘em along a bit.”  He looked at
    the floor.
</p>
<p>
    “What do you mean by ‘helped’?” Albus once again guessed  the answer and
    braced himself for the words that would soon follow.
</p>
<p>
    “Yeh know, jus’ a wee bit o’ magic ter speed up the  process. I needed ‘em
    ready before summer, so’s the kids could get a chance ter  see ‘em. Then
    they’d know how teh spot ‘em if the pixies were Swarmin’, and they  could
    stay clear of ‘em. Like I said. An’ then once they’d learned tha’ bit, I was goin’ teh
    show the kids how to tame ‘em.” Hagrid said with conviction; his explanation
    completely  logical to him. He rushed ahead with his words, the urge
    to make them  understand overwhelming. “Now, I know there’s people ou’ there
    as hates ‘em and  thin's their righ' nasty, bu’ it ain' true I tell yeh. I
    remember ‘ow bad it  was when Lockhart was ‘ere, turnin’ all the kids
    against ‘em. He shouldn’ve  done tha’. As I said, their ‘armless and make
    great pets, ‘slong as yeh know  what yer’re doin’.”
</p>
<p>
    The room was silent. As bizarre as Hagrid’s previous  ventures into creature
    husbandry were, this one was definitely at the top of  the list.
</p>
<p>
    Albus turned towards the hearth once more in thought. It  was several
    moments before he nodded and hummed. Without turning he addressed  Hagrid.
    “So, what you are telling me, Rubeus, is that you raised an entire Colony
    of pixies… Treated them with magic so that they would enter their Swarming
    state earlier than usual… And that they have escaped into the Grounds in
    search  of dung for their nests so that they may beget the next generation?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah, tha’d be abou’ righ', sir.” Hagrid confirmed,  furrowing his brow.
    Then his eyes grew round as saucers as realization set in. “Oh,  no.”
</p>
<p>
    Albus turned around to face his gamekeeper. “If you  hurry, you may be able
    to stop their molting before it’s too late. If you are  unsuccessful, please
    inform me immediately, so that I might gather the needed  help to deal with
    the situation. The last thing we need is for a Colony to take  over
    Hogwarts.”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, sir!” Hagrid nodded vigorously and dashed for the  door, nearly
    ripping it from the hinges as he shut it behind him.
</p>
<p>
    Albus sighed yet again. “At least now we know why Severus  was attacked.”
</p>
<p>
    Pomona made another attempt to apologize, but Albus held  up his hand, then
    his eyes closed in thought. The staff stared at him, waiting  for his
    decision.
</p>
<p>
    “Well, you all have your Assignments. Off with you, now.”  The aged
    headmaster watched them leave one by one through the Floo. He shook  his
    head, exiting through the door and taking the stairs to his office. The
    long walk would do him good.
</p>
<p>
    Albus took his time climbing each step, thinking over all  the possible ways
    in which he could salvage his plans by the end of summer term.  When he
    reached his office, he went straight to his grand claw-foot desk,  passing
    Fawkes on the way and stroking his feathers in the process. He sat in  his
    ornate highbacked chair and sighed before spelling open the locked drawer
    at the bottom right-hand side. He produced a seldom-used, ornate bottle of
    amber liquid and its matching crystal. He was going to need a very large
    brandy indeed.
</p>

<p class="chapterTitle">Break</p>
<img class="pageBreak" src="../images/HP_Page%20Break_Transparent_Large_Purple.png">

<p>
    The remaining week before Easter break flew by and  Severus could not have
    been more grateful. He had spent every spare moment-  save those reserved
    for his communal meal- shut up in his lab, painstakingly  brewing everything
    he could think of to rid himself of the lingering sparkle on  his skin and
    in his hair, to no avail.
</p>
<p>
    In those moments when he’d been forced to take his  breakfasts with the rest
    of the school, he’d caught glimpses of Hagrid and Fang  through the windows
    of the Great Hall speeding about the Grounds, chasing a  nasty looking Swarm
    of pixies- an enormous blue blur, pursued by a rather large  brown blur, and
    followed closely by a much smaller barking grey blur.
</p>
<p>
    The students found this to be <em>hilarious</em> and gave  him plenty of
    excuses to take House points for their merriment. And speaking of
    merriment… Not one word had been spoken within earshot of him about his
    appearance the previous Sunday. Not since the initial comment by a group of
    fourth  year students on Monday, anyway. Oh, how the colour drained from
    their faces  when they’d been caught. Severus managed to take more than one
    hundred points  from them in total that morning.
</p>
<p>
    It was pleasing to know that he still commanded such  authority after what
    they’d witnessed. More pleasing still was that Albus believed  he’d found a
    solution to his Pixie Dust problem, although it wasn’t ready for  testing
    yet. In the meantime, the old man made sure to recount all the details
    pertaining to Serverus’ affliction- which, being an affluent wordsmith with
    apparent oodles of time on his hands, took ages. Then Albus spent less than
    ten  seconds relating to Severus that the Twins were in fact <em>not</em>
    responsible  for said problem, and spent even less time explaining that he
    would not reveal  the guilty party to him until Severus learned how to ‘calm
    down’. But the  Headmaster assured him, that those responsible for turning
    him into a sparkling,  blue spectacle had been thoroughly punished.
</p>
<p>
    It was highly irritating to be kept in the dark with  regards to the
    perpetrators, but Severus brushed it aside to focus on the  other, more
    important information Albus divulged. Kingsley had come through for  him,
    and not only would there be a meeting during the holiday break, but he’d
    secured a time to appear before the Wizengamot.  There would be a
    preliminary hearing to reevaluate  his sentence! It was the best Wednesday
    afternoon that Severus had experienced  in a very long time.
</p>
<p>
    The last day of spring term arrived and those students  who would be leaving
    on the train back to London were milling about as usual.  Severus avoided
    them where he could but was forced to play sentinel by the  Entrance Hall as
    they wandered out to the Grounds in a shrieking, frivolous  mass. When the
    final dunderhead had vanished down the road- signaling the end  of his
    duties- Severus retreated towards the Dungeons in the hopes that his  next
    attempt to remove the glamour-concealed Dust would be his last. Each
    experiment  had left him more and more drained, until he felt it might not
    be possible to  go on, but he knew he was close to a solution. He just had
    to be!
</p>
<p>
    Severus was pulled from his musings by Albus, who had  caught him just as he
    was about to enter his quarters.
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, there you are, my boy.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus held his tongue. He was nearly free for two whole  weeks to hide
    himself away. He just needed to appease the old man for a few  minutes
    longer. “Headmaster.” He nodded politely.
</p>
<p>
    “I was just about to make my rounds of the school to  ensure that everyone
    who needs to leave is on their way. Will you join me for a  stroll?”
</p>
<p>
    “Actually, I am rather busy at the mo-”
</p>
<p>
    “Splendid.” Albus placed his arm around Severus’ shoulder  and steered him
    towards the steps leading back up to the Ground Floor. He was  shuffled
    along as the Headmaster surveyed the Great Hall, the Entrance Hall,  the
    Staffroom and the various classrooms, alcoves, and antechambers. The only
    inhabitants they met were Vector- being cornered by Trelawney with a cup of
    ominous  tea leaves- and Filch coming out of his office with Mrs Norris in
    tow, who  decided that now would be the perfect time to discuss his latest
    strategies for  discipling students. Albus made his excuses though,
    promising Argus a  discussion later, and steering Severus towards the
    staircase.
</p>
<p>
    They ascended to the First Floor and Albus once again  checked his
    surroundings. The hallways and rooms were cleared of all staff and  students
    with the exception of Minerva in her office. Albus waffled on for a  bit
    before she wished them both well and left through the Floo to visit her
    brothers for the holiday. Then the smiling old loon dragged Severus back out
    into the hallway again and towards the landing.
</p>
<p>
    “How are you feeling today?” Albus asked politely as they  waited for the
    moving staircase.
</p>
<p>
    “Fine.”
</p>
<p>
    “Have you been successful in removing any more of the  Dust?”
</p>
<p>
    Severus forced himself to relax his jaw. “I believe I’m  close to a
    solution.”
</p>
<p>
    “I’m so pleased to hear it, my boy. Oh, hello Poppy!” Pomfrey  smiled as she
    approached from the direction of the Hospital wing. The staircase  had
    settled in front of them awaiting their flight, but Albus chose to make
    further small talk instead. Severus watched the stairs move off once more
    and  sighed agitatedly.
</p>
<p>
    “Hello, Headmaster. Severus.” The kindly matron offered.  She had a
    traveling bag clutched under one arm.
</p>
<p>
    “Are you on your way out for the holiday, then?” Albus  asked jovially.
</p>
<p>
    “Yes. My sister is expecting me for dinner. I do feel  terrible for skipping
    out-”
</p>
<p>
    “Nonsense, my dear! You deserve your time away. Margo  will take very good
    care of things until you return.”
</p>
<p>
    “I know she means well, but she is just out of training  at St Mungo’s.
    Are you sure that-”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, yes. Not to worry. I’ll be here just in case she  needs any help.”
    Albus was far too cheerful about it.
</p>
<p>
    “Well-”
</p>
<p>
    “Go on, Poppy. We’ll see you in two weeks.” He waved goodbye,  and she
    continued on her way down to the Ground Floor.
</p>
<p>
    The staircase returned, <em>thank merlin</em>, and they  began to climb once
    more. Severus felt his jaw clenching further with each step  they took.
    <em>
        Just a little longer. You can do this. Let the doddering old fool
        traipse you all over the castle. You’ll be free soon enough.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “You know,” Albus said suddenly, “the meeting with  Kingsley is more for
    show than anything else. All that bureaucratic balderdash…”  He waved his
    hand about as if shooing a fly. “We both know the Wizengamot will  pardon
    you, they have too much evidence in your favour. They know this as well,
    always have, ever since Harry testified on the first day of your trial.”
    Albus  continued speaking as if he were discussing the weather. “It was
    simply a  matter of exhausting their efforts to detain you. Now, they no
    longer have any  excuse to prolong your imprisonment. You are as good as
    freed already, my boy.”
</p>
<p>
    The old man smiled kindly at him, and Severus could only  blink in
    astonishment that he’d once again been kept in the dark over such a
    personal matter. Why, oh, why did Albus always have to play his hand so
    kaleidoscopically?!
</p>
<p>
    “Of course, there is still a mountain of paperwork to be  filed…” Albus
    trailed off, shaking his head at the Ministry’s blatant delaying  tactics.
    “That’s why Kingsley was certain you would be kept here until summer  break,
    and possibly through the autumn term. But you will be free. And no later
    than Christmas. <em>That</em>, I will personally guarantee you.” The
    Headmaster  gazed intently over his half-moon specs at the man he would call
    son if given  the chance.
</p>
<p>
    And Severus believed him. For the first time in his life,  he had no doubt
    that Albus would keep his word. It was strange. There had  always been
    lingering doubt. Ever since he’d lost Lily so many years ago. But  now…
</p>
<p>
    Albus went on speaking as if they were sharing gossip  over afternoon tea.
    “Well, that only gives you… roughly seven months to settle  all your
    affairs, does it not?” The Headmaster chuckled. “Yes, I know
    you’re anxious to get out of Britain as soon as possible, and I don’t blame
    you  after what you’ve been though, my boy.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus could only stare at him as they continued making  the rounds.
</p>
<p>
    “I’ve often thought of traveling the world, myself.”  Albus continued,
    oblivious to his perplexed employee. “There are so many  exciting places to
    visit! But I suppose there’s not enough time in the year for  the Headmaster
    of Hogwarts and Chief Warlock to go trapsing about the globe, is  there?”
</p>
<p>
    Once again, Severus was stunned by the bizarre admission.  How was he to
    respond to such a thing? Surely, he couldn’t reveal his own  desires to run
    off to-
</p>
<p>
    “I guess if there was only one place I could ever go,”  Albus resumed, “it
    would be the South Pacific. Fiji, to be exact. Did you know  they have a
    lovely little magical village down there? Yes, it’s quite beautiful  from
    what I’ve been told.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus just barely suppressed a gasp, his footsteps  nearly faltering. It
    was only his many years as a spy that kept him from giving  anything away.
    <em>How did he…</em> No. That wasn’t possible. Albus couldn’t know  about
    that. It was his most precious secret. He’d never told anyone, not even
    Dream Lily. Surely, this was just a coincidence. But Severus knew the wise
    old  man far too well for that. <em>How does he always know everything…</em>
</p>
<p>
    And Albus continued talking, even with the now stiff-gated  Potions Master
    eyeing him suspiciously. “-iguanas, and bats. Many birds nest  there as
    well, you know. And, of course, there’s mangos everywhere, and they  have
    those lovely little rambutans, and dragon fruit.”
</p>
<p>
    This was simply too much for Severus. What was the old  codger playing at
    with all that stuff about Fiji? Was he deliberately trying to  taunt him
    with it as a means of exacting a final measure of torture against  him?
    Severus felt as if he were slowly being driven insane by want of such  vivid
    descriptions.
</p>
<p>
    Albus just kept on going, “Oh, and there’s this chap- from Liverpool, I
    believe- living there now. He’s rather eccentric from what I  understand.
    Has a few sheep and some cows, and he breeds horses, apparently. I’m  sure it
    looks a strange sight, but there you have it.” He chuckled fondly, then
    went on rambling. “Of course, one needn’t travel so far away. Not if one
    feels  so inclined to take a deeper look around them and notice just how
    unfathomable  life is right outside their very own door. You could spend
    centuries looking  and never see it all…”
</p>
<p>
    The Headmaster sighed happily. “Perhaps just a little  holiday wouldn’t hurt
    though, a small distraction from the mundane… Yes, I  think that’s what I’d
    do, if I had the time. Then, oh, wouldn’t it be a grand  thing indeed to
    settle down in a little cottage, tending my marigolds and  whatnot… Giving
    me the time needed to catch up on things long neglected so very  close to
    home.”
</p>
<p>
    That was it. Severus couldn’t take the old goat’s mumbled  nonsense any
    longer. He nearly had a string of vitriol out of his mouth  when
    Albus placed a hand upon his arm to slow him down.
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, there’s Argus again. He’ll be wanting to set up that  meeting.” Filch
    was panting up the corridor towards them. “Hello, Argus.” Albus  put up his
    hand to stop the caretaker in his tracks. “No, I haven’t the time to  talk
    of punishments just now. Run along with the others and enjoy your holiday.
    And for Merlin’s sake, try to relax while you’re gone. I hate seeing you in
    such a strop when you return.” Filch stared incredulously back at him for a
    moment before wandering off, his mangy old cat following at his heels.
</p>
<p>
    “That man” Albus said, “is far too grumpy. It wouldn’t hurt  him to smile or
    even laugh once in a while… Perhaps if I started giving him the  odd job to
    do around the Grounds with Hagrid, it would lighten his mood. All  that
    lovely sunshine is bound to be good for him.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus cringed at the thought, his mind rapidly filling  with the rather
    scary image of a ‘happy’ Filch frolicking along with Hagrid, while  Fang and
    Ms Norris trotted merrily behind them.
</p>
<p>
    “Well, now. Everything seems to be going along  splendidly.” Albus chimed as
    he finished surveying the Third Floor.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Why does he always get so giddy over the holidays?  Merlin, it’s even
        worse this year- he’s practically bouncing along the  corridor!
    </em>
    “Indeed.” Severus answered curtly.
</p>
<p>
    Albus ignored the Potions Master’s disdain and continued  to hum jauntily as
    they ascended the remaining floors, where the older man took  great care in
    assessing the vacancy of every nook and cranny. When they’d  finally made it
    to the Seventh Floor, Albus did the same, then made an  additional- albeit
    hasty- check that revealed no lingering students other than  those electing
    to stay behind. He greeted them with such mirth that the  students couldn’t
    help but return his infectious smile.
</p>
<p>
    Severus willed his jaw not to crack under the immense  pressure building
    there. He was just about to tell the old man off when Albus steered  him
    along another corridor. That was odd. Severus felt sure they would be
    adjourning to the Headmaster’s office now that the rounds had been complete.
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, here we are at last!” Albus spread his arm out  towards a bare patch of
    wall, beaming.
</p>
<p>
    Severus took a moment to realize exactly where they were.  He had expected
    to see the charred remains of an entryway and splintered door.  But there
    was only the ancient stone before him, <em>and</em> it was no longer secured
    against intrusion by heavy wards. “Albus, this is the former entrance to the
    Room of Requirement.”
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, I’m so glad you noticed, my boy! Yes, and the door  is missing, isn’t
    it?”
</p>
<p>
    “You appear to be correct, Headmaster.”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes. Well, why do you think it is missing?”
</p>
<p>
    “You have finally renovated this area of the castle?” He  deadpanned,
    inspecting the bare wall closely for emphasis. It was the only  place they
    hadn’t been able to heal.
</p>
<p>
    “Yes… and repaired it to its original state.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus whipped his head around quickly. “Repaired?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes. The Room of Requirement is sentient once more and-”
</p>
<p>
    “How is that possible?!” Severus had seen the damage; he  knew it was
    irreparable. Nothing could withstand Fiendfyre!
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, my boy. There are many secrets within Hogwarts.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus just stared at him; brow furrowed.
</p>
<p>
    “In short, it was a lot of hard work performed by your  fellow staff
    members. They were all quite enthusiastic, I must say.” Albus  beamed.
</p>
<p>
    “What?” Severus was momentarily stunned, then incensed by  the man’s gall.
    “Why would you even bother with such a thing? Surely, you  realize how
    dangerous that place can be?!”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, but I have ensured that <em>this</em> time, the room  will obey and
    appear or disappear for the Headmaster, as long as that person is  of pure
    intention and without malice of any kind in their heart.” The twinkle  was
    overwhelming in his eye. “There is no more reason to fret. There will
    always be a safeguard in place from this day forward.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus was perplexed. “But… what rational purpose does  it serve? Why…
    what-” Severus broke off abruptly, incapable of understanding  why the old
    loon would waste his time on something so frivolous. Then he  remembered
    that this was the same man who made everyone personalized Christmas
    crackers.
</p>
<p>
    “Surely, you remember how the Room works?” Albus asked.  He waited a beat,
    letting the younger man gain his bearings before he continued.  “It gives
    you whatever you need, Severus.”
</p>
<p>
    “And…”
</p>
<p>
    “And what you need will be found through that door.”  Albus inclined his
    head towards the pristine woodgrain that had appeared before  them.
</p>
<p>
    Severus contemplated the aged man’s words. He would find  what he needed…

</p>
<p>The cure to rid him of this abominable Pixie Dust!</p>
<p>
    A strange rush of joy, relief, and trepidation swept  across his body, and
    Severus thought for one moment he might sway and possibly  collapse from the
    force of it. The Dust would be gone for good. No more  exhaustive cloaking
    and glamours. But… it wasn’t possible… was it? No. It  couldn’t be. But it
    must be so. Albus wouldn’t be so cruel as to joke about a  thing like that.
    He looked up hopeful at the Headmaster. “Must I walk past it  three times,
    or will it allow me entrance now?”
</p>
<p>
    “Normally, it would require the traditional three passes,  and the intent,
    but as I am the Headmaster of Hogwarts, it will obey me and  allow you
    entrance.” Albus said fondly while the younger man simply stared at  him.
    “Go on, then.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus still couldn’t believe his luck, but he tamped  down his misgivings,
    unwilling to let this opportunity pass him by. He reached  for the doorknob
    and began to turn it, his hand betraying a slight tremor as he  did so while
    another thrill of trepidation sped through him.
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, and Severus?” Albus called out to him.
</p>
<p>
    Severus glanced over his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
    “Good luck and enjoy your holiday.” His smile was broad,  and his twinkling
    eyes shone more brightly than ever.
</p>
<p>
    “Thank you.” Severus barely managed. The sheer happiness emanating  from
    Albus threatened to overwhelm him entirely.
</p>
<p>
    He turned back to the door, focusing his attention fully on  turning the
    knob. There was a faint click and then the door was pushing inward,
    revealing a rather cozy looking room. Severus stepped across the threshold,
    confused. It looked more like someone’s personal quarters than a lab.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        How am I to brew the potion needed to treat  these insufferable sparkles
        with this?!
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Severus shut the door silently behind him as he looked about the room. Perhaps it housed
    something else meant to cure him? The wall to his right held a row of old
    bookcases with an assortment of tomes, some new and pristine, some ancient and
    weathered, others only mildly dog-eared. A small glass-fronted cabinet full of  what
    appeared to be various forms of alcohol was to his left near the door, a
    large bottle of Ogden’s stationed prominently on top. Further along the wall
    was a grand four-poster bed with- <em>ugh</em>- crimson curtains. A large
    hearth  was before him, a merry fire crackling away, with a deep pile
    cream-coloured  rug set before it. Surrounding this were several chairs made
    of soft black  leather and a large comfortable-looking sofa full of-
</p>
<p>
    “<em>LUPIN!</em>”
</p>
<p>
    Remus glanced over his shoulder at Severus from his  position, dislodging
    someone from their respite against his arm. A head full of  luxurious, curly
    black hair shifted upward to reveal-
</p>
<p>
    “<em>BLACK!</em>”
</p>
<p>
    “Hello, Severus.” Remus said, his brow furrowed slightly.  “What are you
    doing here?”
</p>
<p>
    “You what?” Severus found it very difficult to pull his  thoughts together.
    This was the absolute last thing he’d expected.
</p>
<p>
    “It’s not that I’m not pleased to see you, but we weren’t  expecting you.”
    Remus replied kindly, standing from the sofa.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius jumped up quickly to stand beside his lover.  “Yeah. We’re on
    assignment from Dumbledore, to check out the new Room and make  sure it’s in
    working order. He never said anything about <em>you</em> being  here.” He
    quipped irritably.
</p>
<p>
    Severus drew his wand on the pair before him, panic gnawing  at the back his
    mind as he surmised the three of them were alone together.
</p>
<p>
    “Whoa, Severus.” Remus cautioned; his hands raised before  him. “What’s the
    problem?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>What’s the problem?</em> “YOU are the problem! BOTH of you!” He flicked
    his wand towards Black, who had  drawn his own wand looking even more
    perturbed than before.
</p>
<p>
    “You intruded upon us, you Great Bat!” Sirius shouted.
</p>
<p>
    “Now, Sirius-”
</p>
<p>
    “No, Remus! Not this time. He comes in here, in the  middle of our
    assignment and thinks he can just badger us about. Well, I’ll not  stand for
    it!”
</p>
<p>
    Remus sighed and rubbed his forehead. “Look. I don’t know  what’s going on
    here, but I’m sure Severus didn’t mean any harm to either of  us.”
</p>
<p>
    Sirius looked at him incredulously. “Why do you always do  that?! You know
    he’s not worth it!”
</p>
<p>
    “You seemed to think differently last week, and seven  months ago, and
    roughly a year-and-a-half ago as well.” Remus crossed his arms  and stared
    down his husband pointedly.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius pressed his palms into his eyes and groaned.
</p>
<p>
    “Deny it all you want. I remember just how wanton you  were on those
    occasions.”
</p>
<p>
    Sirius sniffed, flicking his hair over his shoulder and  not looking at
    Remus.
</p>
<p>
    Severus viewed their exchange, rapidly piecing together  the information and
    coming to the same conclusion he’d begun panicking over  previously. Slowly,
    and after several deep breaths to calm himself, he said  “Dumbledore sent
    you here?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes.” Remus supplied, then blinked as recognition stole  over his face. “He
    sent you to check out the room as well?”
</p>
<p>
    “I was invited here to solve my little <em>problem</em>.”  Severus ground
    out, his jaw hurting from the effort of speaking through his  tightly
    clenched teeth.
</p>
<p>
    “The ‘sparkles’? There still affecting you- oh, you’re  using a glamour.”
    Remus nodded in understanding.
</p>
<p>
    “What sparkles?” Sirius asked, confused.
</p>
<p>
    Severus sneered his answer at the bloody wolf.
</p>
<p>
    “Ah.” Remus acknowledged. “I am sorry you haven’t had any  luck. Perhaps I
    can help? I’m sure that’s why Albus sent you up here.” He tried  to sound as
    innocent as possible; he didn’t want Severus to think he’d had a  hand in
    whatever the Headmaster had devised.
</p>
<p>
    “What sparkles?!” Sirius asked again, more demanding.
</p>
<p>
    Severus looked at the irritating pureblood, the man was  practically irate
    with the thought of being excluded from something. Black  didn’t know… That
    surprised him. Why hadn’t Lupin said anything? Surely,  Severus didn’t
    warrant such kindness as to keep such a damning secret from the  mutt.
</p>
<p>
    A twisted sense of satisfaction wound its way around him as he realized  that
    maybe there were things that the idiot wasn’t privy to. He smirked.</p>
<p>
    “This.” Severus flicked his wand to remove his glamour  and Black fell back
    a step, his eyes wide in shock and wonderment.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius continued to stare at Severus for a moment longer,  there were far
    too many words bouncing around in his head. “Wow.” He breathed  in awe.
</p>
<p>
    Severus was taken aback by the conviction in Black’s  voice. He’d expected
    taunting and teasing and even a roiling, uncontrollable  guffaw, but not…
    reverence. The mutt continued staring at Severus, his eyes  still full of
    wonder. It made him far more uneasy than any joke ever could.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius was stunned, pure and simple. He wanted to speak  further, but his
    mouth just couldn’t form the words. This was probably the most  bizarre
    thing he’d ever seen, and he lived with a group of forever-pranking
    Marauders for seven years. Eventually he managed to clear his throat and
    blink  away the sting from his overtaxed eyes. “I never would have believed
    it ten  minutes ago… but now… you just… wow.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus was unsure how to react. Was the idiot playing  him or was his
    stupidity finally breaking him down into a mute. He cut his  usual sneer and
    prompted, “I must say that’s probably you most abysmal gibe  yet. I would
    have thought you’d at least get in a good quip about how
    <em>
        illuminating
    </em>
    this makes me.”
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah, well. It’s hard to bother you when you look like  that. I mean, how
    often do you come across a sparkly vampire?” Sirius supplied.  Still trying
    to tear his eyes away from the spectacle before him.
</p>
<p>
    Remus chuckled. Then, seeing Severus tensing his  shoulders he said, “I’m
    sorry, Severus. I’m not laughing at you. It’s just,  well… you do look a
    great deal like a sparkly vampire.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus glared at him. “Alright. You beasts have had your  fun. OUT!” He
    gestured with his wand towards the door, moving away from it so  they could
    get by.
</p>
<p>
    “No can do, Snape. Albus gave us a task, and we can’t  leave until we’re
    done.” Sirius crossed his arms, looking smug.
</p>
<p>
    “I think Severus might be part of that task, Sirius.”  Remus implied
    nervously.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius just stared at him for a moment, a worrying  question on his face.
    Then, “Oh, no.”
</p>
<p>
    Remus let out a soft chuckle. “Yeah. I think our beloved  Headmaster has
    been plotting again.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus could see them putting the rest of the pieces  together. Black
    fidgeted and cleared his throat, looking down at the floor.  Lupin chuckled
    and shook his head, a small smile playing at the corner of his  mouth.
    Severus would put an end to this charade right now. “When is he never  not
    plotting something, Lupin. Regardless, I have better things to do than
    stand around consorting with the likes of you. Now, as I said, leave so that
    I  might finally be rid of these infernal sparkles!” He growled.
</p>
<p>
    Remus looked at him then, his eyes twinged with remorse.  “Please don’t do
    this. If Albus has set this whole thing up just to bring us  together, don’t
    you think we should at least try to see it through?”
</p>
<p>
    Severus felt like exploding but kept his ire under  control. Slowly he
    lowered his wand and crossed his arms over his chest. “No.”  he said with
    deadly reassurance. “I am through with Albus and his meddlesome  games, and
    I want nothing to do with either of you ever again.” He saw the hurt  in
    Lupin’s eyes and pushed down his guilt.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius stiffened immediately, acutely sensing Remus’  distress. “Fine with
    us. We don’t want anything to do with you, either.” His  voice was cold,
    forcing the unexpected sting from his heart with his words.  “Come on, love.
    Let’s get out of here.” He reached his hand out towards Remus.
</p>
<p>
    Remus looked at Severus imploringly. He sighed then,  knowing that it
    was pointless… for the moment anyway. He wouldn’t give up that  easily. He’d
    simply need to bide his time until he could try again another day.
    “Alright. Let’s go. We’ll tell Albus the Room is functioning normally and be
    on  our way.” He joined hands with Sirius, and they walked to the door.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius gave Snape a haughty flick of his head. He faced  the door and
    turned the knob, or at least that’s what he tried to do. “Um,  Remus?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes.”
</p>
<p>
    “I think we may have a problem here.”
</p>
<p>
    “What’s the matter?”
</p>
<p>
    “The knob’s stuck.”
</p>
<p>
    Remus couldn’t help the snort that escaped him. “That’s  what <em>he</em>
    said.” then chuckle. “I’m sorry, I- I just couldn’t help it.” he  added upon
    seeing Sirius’ flared nostrils. “I’m sorry.” He apologized again,  his
    nervousness over the whole situation bleeding through.
</p>
<p>
    “I thought I was the immature one.” Sirius grumbled. He  was now frantically
    jiggling the knob to no avail.
</p>
<p>
    Remus pushed forward and batted Sirius away. “Let me  handle it.”
</p>
<p>
    “Now, <em>that’s</em> what <em>he</em> said.” Sirius laughed  bodily.
</p>
<p>
    “Pot, kettle.” Remus chided him before focusing on the  door once more.
    “Hmm… I don’t think it’s stuck, Sirius. I think we’re locked  in.”
</p>
<p>
    “WHAT!” Severus shouted. He barreled towards them; his  wand outstretched.
    “Move!” He performed a wordless <em>Alohomora</em> upon the  door, then
    reached for the knob himself. He turned it, but nothing happened.
    Carefully, and with all his concentration on the lock before him, he
    commanded  his voice. “<em>Alohomora</em>.” And nothing happened. Dread
    filled him as realization  set in. “Fuck me.”
</p>
<p>
    Sirius snorted. “That’s what <em>he</em>-”
</p>
<p>
    Severus trained his wand directly between Black’s eyes,  daring him-
    <em>
        willing him,
    </em>
    even – to finish his sentence.
</p>
<p>
    “I think Albus wants us to stay in here for a while.”  Remus supplied
    cautiously.
</p>
<p>
    Severus turned to him sharply. “Really? I would never  have known!” he
    shouted.
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t you dare yell at Remus!” Sirius puffed out his  chest as he
    brandished his own wand once more.
</p>
<p>
    “There’s no need to be hostile.” Remus had put up his  hands between each of
    them. “The three of us can work this out like adul-”
</p>
<p>
    “There is nothing to work out, Lupin.” Severus stowed his  wand away but
    glared menacingly at Remus.
</p>
<p>
    “Isn’t there?”
</p>
<p>
    “No.” Severus’ tone was final.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius scoffed. “I told you, Moony. He’s not worth it.”  He glared at
    Severus and spat, “Greasy bastard.”
</p>
<p>
    “Demented mutt.” Severus returned venomously.
</p>
<p>
    “Stop it, both of you!” Remus rubbed his hand across his  face. “I’m so
    tired of the fighting. There is no reason why we can’t make this  work.”
</p>
<p>
    “Speak for yourself, Lupin. I have already said my piece  and I will not
    yield to either of you!”
</p>
<p>
    “Who said you had to yield to anything?!” Sirius barked  indignantly.
</p>
<p>
    Severus turned on him. “You and your precious <em>fling</em>.  I want no
    part of it. You cannot simply call upon me whenever you want to ‘spice things  up’.
    Wasn’t that how you put it, Black?”
</p>
<p>
    “I never-”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, yes you did!” Severus snapped. “
    <em>
        We’ve been so  bored, lately. Lucky you happened along, Snape.”
    </em>
    Severus affected in a  whiney tone, imitating Sirius perfectly.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius huffed. “It was mutually beneficial. Besides, you  were rather eager
    at the time. Desperate even.” He smirked knowingly.
</p>
<p>
    So Black wasn’t as dumb as he looked after all, Severus  realized. He’d
    hoped that neither one of them would cotton on to his need, he’d  taken
    great care to appear indifferent but apparently his mask had slipped  during
    their little… <em>entanglements</em>. He couldn’t let them get the upper
    hand, though. “You used me.” he said dangerously.
</p>
<p>
    “You used <em>us</em>!” Sirius shouted.
</p>
<p>
    “THAT’S ENOUGH!” Remus bellowed. He fought to keep his  breathing under
    control. When he was calm once more and the protracted silence  felt
    suffocating, he continued. “Look, we all had something to gain from that
    first encounter, and yes, perhaps it was simply scratching an itch, but for
    fuck’s sake, it’s not that simple anymore!”
</p>
<p>
    Both men just stared at Remus, taken aback by his  outburst. The fight
    leached out of them as they continued watching, wondering  what else he’d
    say.
</p>
<p>
    “I meant what I said before. I am tired of this incessant  bickering. Every
    time I have broached the subject of making this work <em>both  of you</em>
    dissolve into petulant children. Well, not this time.” He gave them  a
    moment to adjust to his admonition, then continued. “Look. There’s
    something… <em>more</em> to this relationship than either of you want to
    admit, but it’s  there still the same. I know you can both feel it.”
</p>
<p>
    Sirius huffed and Severus sneered.
</p>
<p>
    “We are going to give this a shot- no, Severus, just  listen!” Remus added
    quickly, noting that he was anxious to draw his wand  again. “We owe it to
    ourselves to at least try.”
</p>
<p>
    “Remus, I thought we’d already discussed this.” Sirius  eyed him
    meaningfully.
</p>
<p>
    “No. You prattled on about how much you hated the whole  thing and just went
    along with it to appease me. Which I know for a fact is  utter shite,
    Sirius.”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, do you now?” Sirius snipped.
</p>
<p>
    “Yes.” Remus declared severely. “You wanted him just as  badly as I did that
    first night and rarely talked of anything else for weeks  afterward. You can
    deny it all you want, but I saw the look in your eyes and  the way you
    carried yourself every time we encountered Severus. I could feel  the magic
    radiating off you. Hell, if we would’ve wired you up to the national  grid,
    you’d probably have burnt out the whole of London.”
</p>
<p>
    Sirius shifted agitatedly but said nothing.
</p>
<p>
    Severus scoffed and rolled his eyes.
</p>
<p>
    “And you.” Remus stared down the irate Potions Master.  “Don’t you dare try
    to hide it from me. I can hear your heartbeat racing; I can  smell you
    sweating nervously whenever you’re close. I know how badly you need  us.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus opened his mouth to vehemently protest, but he  was cut off by Lupin
    once again.
</p>
<p>
    “We need you, too.” Remus added kindly, softly. The way  he always did with
    Severus. Wanting him to understand just how much he meant to  him, to them.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius growled. “I do not <em>need</em> him, Remus.” He  said disgustedly.
    Remus stared him down knowingly and Sirius found himself  speechless once
    again. He looked away from him, he couldn’t let Remus see the  truth in his
    eyes. It was one thing to fool around and play it off as a stupid  fling,
    but to admit something more was possible… that he’d felt the urge to  make
    something more of it… He was both intrigued and repulsed at the same time.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius hated Snape. He hated him. Hated him! HATED HIM!!!
</p>
<p>
    Didn’t he?…
</p>
<p>
    Did he ever?…
</p>
<p>
    …Surely, when they were kids… Why else would he have spent so many hours
    trying to prank the Slytherin at every turn… It was such an easy thing to
    do… So much simpler than thinking about what it all truly meant to him… And
    the way Snape would respond so viciously to his attacks… It was a rather heady
    experience to say the least… And the years after that, when they’d fight at
    Order meetings… Even now, with the post-War meetings every fortnight, wanting
    to see those fathomless onyx orbs pierce him, hear that deep velvety tone berate
    him…
</p>
<p>
    Shit.
</p>
<p>
    Remus was right. He’d done everything he could to deny  it, but it was
    there. And the promise of a future with his once-archrival sent  shivers
    down his spine. How the bloody fuck did Sirius Black, one of the  greatest
    pranksters and most beguiling people in the world, end up fancying a
    crooked old Git like Snape? He was drawn from his musing by that velvety
    voice  he’d so recently become addicted to snapping at him.
</p>
<p>
    “And I certainly don’t need either of you.” Severus  growled. He had to
    stop them talking about such a farce. Nothing was ever  going to come from
    it. He would not allow himself to-
</p>
<p>
    “Fine.” Remus conceded testily. “So, we don’t <em>need</em> each other.” He
    waited a beat for them to let their guard down. “But we <em>want</em> each
    other, and neither of you can deny it.”
</p>
<p>
    “We’ve spent less time  together than what would amass to a twenty-four-hour
    period.” Severus spat.  “You know nothing about me.” he added in a deathly quiet voice.
</p>
<p>
    “I’d like to get to know you better, if only you’d let  me. Merlin knows
    I’ve tried.” Remus sighed. “And, for the record, I wasn’t  lying when I said
    I could tell you wanted us.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus scoffed again. “Of course.” He rolled his eyes.
</p>
<p>
    “My senses haven’t failed me yet.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus furrowed his brow.
</p>
<p>
    “Werewolf.” Remus supplied.
</p>
<p>
    Oh. Severus hadn’t thought of that, hadn’t known it was  possible to garner
    that sort of knowledge. He sighed exhaustively. There was  nowhere else to
    hide.
</p>
<p>
    “Now that we’ve got that all cleared up. I hope you two  will listen and not
    fight.” Remus continued. “So, here we are. In a nice cozy  place. We’ve
    hashed out our fledgling relationship. What more needs to be said,  other
    than when we’ll make the next move?”
</p>
<p>
    Neither Sirius nor Severus were forthcoming so Remus once  again, like the
    Gryffindor that he was, took the plunge. “How about dinner  tonight? Sirius
    and I can do the shop. Severus, you can join us, say… about  seven?”
</p>
<p>
    “Should I bring a bottle of wine.” Severus intoned  mockingly.
</p>
<p>
    “If you’d like.” Remus replied cloyingly.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius snorted.  “This is insane.” He shook his head.
</p>
<p>
    “Much like yourself.” Severus taunted.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius puffed himself up again, spoiling for a fight.  That familiar light
    gleaming in his eye.
</p>
<p>
    Severus’ lip curled. He too showed all the signs of  relishing another
    confrontation.
</p>
<p>
    “I suppose that’s settled then.” Remus spoke quickly, startling both of his
    lovers from their mounting fervor. “Shall we?” he  motioned towards the
    door.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius tossed his hair over his shoulder and walked off. He turned the knob and
    pulled, but the door remained firmly in place. “Remus?” He cast
    <em>Alohomora</em> just to be sure, and still nothing happened.
</p>
<p>
    “I haven’t gotten rid of these dratted sparkles, yet.”  Severus growled.
</p>
<p>
    “Ah.” Remus nodded. He looked about the room as he  thought of what to do.
    It felt lived in, comfortable, a place you’d be wanting  to come home to
    every day. He noticed the large four-poster off to one side but  quickly put
    it out of his mind. Wishful thinking wouldn’t help them now.
</p>
<p>
    Still Remus felt the inviting pull of the place beckoning  to him, wanting
    him to settle down onto the sofa or into one of the armchairs.  His eyes
    swept the room again, darting over to the bed once more and lingering
    there. It called to him, and he wondered if the others could feel it too.
    Not  that they would ever get near the four-poster, of course. Severus would
    probably hex him if he even suggested it.
    <em>
        Baby steps this time, Remus
    </em>
    .
</p>
<p>
    The clinking of glass brought Remus out of his thoughts.  Sirius was pouring
    Ogden’s for himself, as well as filling two other tumblers.  Severus
    stiffened as Sirius held out the glasses towards them in offering. Remus
    approached and took both, encouraging Severus to take one of them from him.
    Severus huffed but took it anyway. Remus couldn’t help but brush his finger
    lightly along the Potions Master’s hand as he did so, the tips of their
    fingers  touching briefly before he pulled away entirely.
</p>
<p>
    Then the most remarkable thing happened. The place where  he had grazed
    Severus changed. The sparkles dissolved away.
</p>
<p>
    “Now, that’s interesting.” Remus mused.
</p>
<p>
    Severus was staring at his finger in wonder.
</p>
<p>
    “Hmm… I think we’ve been going about this the wrong way.”  Remus surmised.
    “Sirius?” He gestured for his husband to stand close. Sirius  complied, a
    curious frown on his face. “Touch Severus’ hand.”
</p>
<p>
    Sirius had an idea of where Remus was going with this,  but felt doubtful it
    would work. Even so, he brought his hand up to brush  against the back of
    Severus’, trailing his fingers outward and towards himself  as he did so.
    The sparkles diminished and disappeared. “Huh.” Sirius couldn’t  believe it.
    <em>What sort of magic is this?</em>
</p>
<p>
    “Fascinating.” Remus took Sirius’ hand and brought it  together with his
    own, then settled both against Severus’ palm. This time, the  combined
    effort removed not only the sparkles from Severus’ palm, but also what
    remained on his fingers. Severus turned his hand, inspecting it from all
    sides.  The Dust was gone.
</p>
<p>
    “Well, that’s something, then. Isn’t it?” Sirius  supplied.
</p>
<p>
    The three of them looked at each other, momentarily  struck dumb by such a
    bizarre turn of events. Then Remus let out a hearty  guffaw.
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, that barmy old man! How could I not have seen it?!”  He continued to
    laugh as the others stared at him. When he could speak again,  he said “This
    is the ‘Room of Requirement’. And Albus rebuilt it to his own
    specifications, right?” They nodded silently. “Don’t you get it? The Room
    doesn’t give you what you require, you are required to give it what it wants
    if  you ever hope to get out again.” He continued to chuckle, then stopped
    abruptly  and frowned. “Or at least, I think that’s what he had planned.”
    His frown  deepened. “I certainly hope he doesn’t leave it like this for
    anyone else.”
</p>
<p>
    “So… we’re ‘required’ to touch Severus to get rid of his  sparkles… so that
    we can leave.” Sirius looked at him oddly.
</p>
<p>
    “It’s a completely mad notion, but you know what Albus is  like.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus had to agree that it was ludicrous, and even more  so that the
    Headmaster was daft as a brush. He looked down at his hand to see  the
    sparkles reappearing. “Gah!”
</p>
<p>
    Both men started but quickly looked down at Severus’ hand  to discover for
    themselves the little hiccup in their newly formed plan. Remus  thought for
    a moment, his brow furrowed, then took hold of Sirius’ hand once  more and
    together with his own, applied it to those dexterous, glittering  fingers.
    The Dust began to recede again, and Sirius made to pull away, but  Remus
    held him fast. The touch lasted far longer this time, and so, the sparkles
    kept receding until they disappeared up under the cuff of Severus’ robes.
</p>
<p>
    “I think we might be required to do more than simply  touch him, Sirius. Or
    at least, we might need to be in contact for an extended  period of time.”
    He half chuckled, half groaned at the plot Albus must have  devised for
    them. Knowing that his former Headmaster was thinking about them on  that
    level was a little disconcerting, and he hoped that it was more of a
    general spell than something with specifics involved. He really didn’t want
    to  think about Albus paying too much close attention to their activities.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius failed to hide his large grin behind a mask of  indifference. “Yeah,
    well. I suppose I can handle anything. Might need a  breather now and then,
    though.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus wasn’t sure whether to be furious, flattered, or  impishly coy. In
    the end his childish side won out, surprising both his lovers  with a
    “That’s what <em>he</em> said.”
</p>
<p>
    They stared at him for a moment, then  their faces split
    into identical grins, and they burst out laughing. Severus  joined in with
    his telltale smirk. The air was suddenly lighter in the Room and  each man
    felt contentment wash over him. They sipped their Firewhisky, quietly
    mulling over the events of their day so far, and occasionally stealing glances
    at  one another.
</p>
<p>
    “So…” Remus broached at last, “How should we proceed,  then?” He looked at
    Severus, the man was affecting a bored expression, but  Remus could
    practically feel the staccato of his heart. He approached and  Severus
    stiffened slightly. “Can I touch you?”
</p>
<p>
    Severus inhaled deeply, wanting to express his thoughts  but unable to do so
    in that moment. It was difficult to concentrate with Remus  so close to him.
    All those feelings he evoked… Part of him wanted to shout  ‘No!’ and hex the
    wolf, part of him wanted to run from the room, and part of  him desperately
    wanted to feel the man’s arms wrapped around him again. And now  that he
    knew that Remus could sense it, there was no point in denying his want  to
    either of them, or to himself.
</p>
<p>
    He felt that nagging little voice resurface in the back  of his mind,
    whispering such sweet words of comfort… but this time, he didn’t  try to
    shut it out. He exhaled a long, slow breath he hadn’t realized he was
    holding and dropped his mask enough to let Remus see his intentions. The
    wolf  smiled at him and stepped closer, tentatively running his hand along
    Severus’  arm, so delicately, as if he were made of fine china.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius cleared his throat as he approached. “How long do  you think this
    might take to cure?” He asked, letting his fingers brush against  Severus’
    hand.
</p>
<p>
    Remus shook his head and chuckled. “Hours, days, weeks.  Who knows what that
    silly old sod had planned.”
</p>
<p>
    “W-weeks?” Sirius nearly squeaked out, a hint of panic in  his voice. He
    cleared his throat, quickly recovering himself and affecting his  usual
    haughty attitude when flustered. “I mean, honestly, I’m thrilled with the
    prospect, but are we really going to stay in here over the entire Easter
    break?” He began to fidget.
</p>
<p>
    “Problem, Black?” Severus snipped, his insecurity rearing  its ugly head
    again.
</p>
<p>
    “No! I already said as much, didn’t I? I was only curious  if it might go on
    all the way to Easter. You know, well, we were expected at  the Burrow this
    year, with Harry and everyone…”
</p>
<p>
    Remus grinned wickedly.
</p>
<p>
    Severus couldn’t fail to notice that. “Something I should  know about?”
</p>
<p>
    “No.” Sirius dismissed nonchalantly and altogether too  quickly.
</p>
<p>
    Remus chuckled. “I think Sirius might be a bit concerned  about how Harry
    will take this news.” He grinned again.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius cleared his throat. “It’s no big deal. I mean, it is,  but just
    between us, right? There’s no need to go telling everyone about it, is
    there?” he said nervously.
</p>
<p>
    “Embarrassed to be acquainted with me?” Severus asked,  his tone reserved,
    but more out of curiosity than hurt.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius let out a rather undignified tittering laugh. “No.  It’s just-”
</p>
<p>
    “It’s just that Harry thinks the world of you, Severus.  And when he
    discovers that his favorite War Hero is entangled with his highly  revered
    godfather, he’ll probably melt right through the floor in adoration.”
</p>
<p>
    “Remus!” Sirius snapped. “You didn’t need to tell him  that!”
</p>
<p>
    “Why not?” Remus asked coyly.
</p>
<p>
    “Because… because…” Sirius stammered as he continued to  fidget.
</p>
<p>
    “Because” Severus began, his voice low and sinister, a  wickedly malicious
    grin spreading across his face, “if your godson knew you  were in a
    relationship with me, he would think it <em>sweet</em>, and that would
    embarrass you to no end.” He finished, the feverish gleam in his eyes boring
    straight into Sirius’ soul.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius let out a whimpering sigh in defeat.
</p>
<p>
    Severus let out a dark chuckle. “When are we expected?
</p>
<p>
    Sirius hung his head and groaned.
</p>
<p>
    Remus looked in awe of Severus. “Oh, you truly are a  deviant, aren’t’ you?”
    He couldn’t help his own chuckle.
</p>
<p>
    “When… are we… expected?” Severus inquired devilishly.
</p>
<p>
    Remus chuckled again. “I believe Molly is serving dinner  at two.”
</p>
<p>
    ‘Shit.” Sirius huffed. He looked at Severus, his lips drawn  in a thin line
    of agitation. “Would you really do such a thing?”
</p>
<p>
    “I might.” Severus purred, relishing his sudden power over the man. He had no real
    intension whatsoever of going anywhere near the Weasley clan. But Black didn't need to
    know that. Although… it would give him  an excuse to speak with Molly about her sons… He’d
    leave it open-ended for now.
</p>
<p>Sirius couldn’t suppress the slight shutter that overcame him with those words. Oh, that deep,
    velvety rumble! How could the sinister man before him sound so fucking good while he was trying
    to torture him?! Well, two could play that game.</p>
<p>
    The impish gleam had returned to Sirius’ eyes. “Then we  should get started,
    don’t you think?” He took a sly step closer. “I mean, just  in case you
    truly feel like ruining my reputation, and all that.” Another step,  an even
    darker gleam, a sultry smile.
</p>
<p>
    “Indeed.” Severus concurred, his own smile domineering.
</p>
<p>
    “No hexing each other, now.” Remus interjected as he  brought his hands up
    to encompass both of his lovers. His breath deepening with  the rightness of
    them in his arms.
</p>
<p>
    “No hexing.” Sirius answered, his breath taking on a  shallow edge in his
    excitement.
</p>
<p>
    “Agreed.” Severus dropped his mask further, allowing them  both to see the
    fire building within.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius ran his finger along Severus’ jaw line, making him  shiver. “So, do
    these sparkles affect everything they touch, then? I mean, do you have sparkly pants
    as well?” He looked down briefly.
</p>
<p>
    Severus gazed at him. “I suppose you’ll just need to find out for yourself.” Then he
    began to unbutton his frock coat, one excruciatingly slow button  at a time.
</p>

<p>
    They were holding hands.
</p>
<p>
    Something no one from the U.K. would have ever believed  of Severus Snape.
    <em>If</em> they had seen him. But he and Remus were on a  sun-kissed beach
    more than a thousand kilometers away, spending the Christmas holiday  together and
    blissfully happy with their arrangement- thank you very much. Well,  as
    happy as one could expect from the prickly Potions Master, anyway. This was
    in fact the first time Severus had held anyone’s hand in public, being
    unaccustomed  to such displays of affection. Not that he was worried about
    what the local  wizards of Tan hae Hefhefu might think of him. They were
    dear people and had embraced  their visitors immediately with a customary
    mamasa- a welcoming ceremony  complete with päega, tefui, and koua-
    Although, they did take several days to fully  decipher the seemingly Dark,
    well-reserved man.
</p>
<p>
    The locals got on with Severus very well after that, having  discovered that
    his obstinance was just a facade. Why the Dark Brit would want  to keep them
    at bay in the first place was beyond them. He was a rather likable  fellow
    after all. Mostly. Severus was always respectful- he was even fluent in their
    own language- and quite pleasant at times. They’d even caught him smiling once
    or twice as well and laughing heartily  with his companions on occasion.
</p>
<p>
    They found the Potions Master quite fascinating.  Everything from his
    reserved manner to his vampire-like appearance.  Severus- whose
    complexion had always been rather pale but was most certainly <em>not</em> a
    vampire- made sure to pack plenty of his specially brewed sun cream before
    he  left England, knowing it would be necessary if he didn’t want to end up
    burnt  to a crisp. This product greatly intrigued the indigenous islanders,
    who, although  not nearly as prone to inflammatory reactions from the sun,
    did suffer at  times.
</p>
<p>
    They had their own potions of course, which were  incredibly efficient and
    encompassed centuries worth of great ingenuity, but they  had never created
    anything quite like <em>that</em> before. Severus truly was a gifted  Potioneer. If
    he were to set up shop someday, they would readily welcome it and  recommend
    his products to any wizard unfortunate enough to suffer such an  ailment-
    That incomer with all the horses probably wouldn’t need much, but the tall,
    pale, snippy man with that H stuck to his forehead might find it useful when
    he  visited occasionally.
</p>
<p>
    There was even a recent vacancy in the village that would  be perfect for
    Severus, with room at the back for a large garden so that he might
    cultivate his stock. But the locals wouldn’t push. They understood that
    Severus  was the sort of man that wouldn’t budge until he was ready.
    Besides, they knew this  was merely a holiday for him and his companions. A
    time to be carefree, to have  a laugh, to indulge in their recent good
    fortune before returning home  together.
</p>
<p>
    These companions spent much of their time walking the  length of the beach
    or roaming about the forests, but the cliffs and the  grottos were given a
    thorough investigation as well, and soon the three men had  the entire
    island ‘Mapped’ out for future excursions. Much like today, as they  had
    been spotted climbing down from the cliffs that faced the moist forest, and
    meandering towards the bay. Each of them dressed in their typical attire of
    relaxed  fitting linen beach shirts and trousers.
</p>
<p>
    It was nearly noon, and the tide was flowing in again,  the waves gently
    lapping at their bare, bronzed ankles. Remus was still holding  Severus’
    hand, squeezing ever so slightly, as if he feared somehow the prickly
    Potions Master might suddenly disappear on him. And Sirius, or rather, the
    large black dog he’d transformed into earlier that morning, was currently
    running round their heels and barking at nothing in particular.
</p>
<p>
    “Watch it, Sirius. You’re getting under foot.” Remus  said, staggering
    around the bounding, black blur.
</p>
<p>
    “Shall I conjure a lead? We could tie him to the breadfruit  tree over
    there.” Severus nodded in the direction of their bungalow.
</p>
<p>
    “We may have to at this rate.” Remus supplied.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius made another run past Remus’ legs and bound back  into the surf. Then
    he caught sight of a few plovers further along the beach and  changed
    direction, speeding off and barking happily as he went. They took  flight
    and Sirius continued to give chase, headless of the small outcropping of
    volcanic rocks before him. He leapt fearlessly over them and landed on the
    warm  sand beyond without so much as a scratch. Remus was shouting at him
    about  something now, and he yelped delightedly before speeding back towards
    him quick  as a flash.
</p>
<p>
    “Calm down, you pillock-OOF!” Remus stumbled into Severus  as the mad animal
    leapt past him at an incoming swell.
</p>
<p>
    Severus caught him deftly, his spy reflexes still highly attuned  even after
    all these years.
</p>
<p>
    Remus had his arms around the snarky man, at first to  steady himself, but
    now… “Thanks.” he said kindly, drawing himself even closer  to his lover. He
    smiled and tilted his head forward and to one side.
</p>
<p>
    Severus responded with a small smile as he too, tilted  his head, allowing
    his lips to-
</p>
<p>
    Sirius barreled right into him, knocking both of his lovers to the ground and
    soaking their trousers in the swell that had just come in.
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, you mangy cur!” Severus shouted, brandishing his  wand. He got a face
    full of dog for that, the beast’s tongue licking broadly across  his cheek.
    “Ugh! You-” A lick on the other cheek. “That’s it!”
</p>
<p>
    Remus couldn’t help but laugh. “Oh, Sev-” Sirius bowled  him over and
    slobbered over his cheek as well. “Yuck, Sirius! Don’t-” he braced  his arms
    across his face, protecting himself as best he could, all the while  Severus
    could be heard chuckling darkly in the background. “Stop, damn it!” he
    tried again. “Stop, or I’ll never scratch behind your ears again!” At that,
    Remus found himself with a lap full of wizard, Sirius having quickly changed
    back at such words.
</p>
<p>
    “You wouldn’t dare.” Sirius feigned, his eyes wide in  mock terror.
</p>
<p>
    “I would.” Remus crossed his arms looking more amused  than anything else.
    He was rather distracted by the impish man straddling his  outstretched
    legs.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius gave him such a petulant pout. “You sound just  like him.” He nodded
    towards Severus.
</p>
<p>
    “It serves you right for tripping us up like that.” Remus  argued.
</p>
<p>
    “I didn’t mean to.” Sirius said innocently. “I couldn’t  help but frisk
    about, the waves were just too tempting!”
</p>
<p>
    “Indeed.” Severus snarked.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius huffed. “Fine, I’ll just go for a swim in the  Lagoon.”
</p>
<p>
    “You bloody well will not, Sirius Black!” Remus stared incredulously  at his
    fanciful husband.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius huffed again. “You’re no fun at all.” He looked  away and crossed his
    arms over his chest.
</p>
<p>
    “There are sharks in there, you idiot!”
</p>
<p>
    “They’re only pups.”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, but what if you hurt them with all your thrashing  about in the
    nursery? Some of them are quite small, you know.”
</p>
<p>
    “I’ll swim as gently as I can. They won’t even notice me.”
</p>
<p>
    “And what if you spook a Thresher? You know how dangerous  their tails can
    be. We might not have enough dittany to patch you up after that  kind of
    attack.” Remus scolded.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius just rolled his eyes and scoffed haughtily. “That’s  what repelling
    charms are for.”
</p>
<p>
    “Well, what if you run into a Great White? Kiana told us  they come into the
    lagoon at times. One of those could gobble you up whole,  charms and all.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus smirked, then reached over to the nearby flotsam  that had recently
    washed ashore and plucked a knobbly stick of driftwood from  the pile. He
    tossed it with vigor- and a little magic- towards the lagoon where  it made
    a distant splash. “Fetch.” He commanded, grinning wickedly at Sirius.
</p>
<p>
    And Sirius grinned right back at him, his eyes narrowed  and smoldering.
    “Sorry.” He purred low and silkily, taking a page from his snarky  lover’s
    book, “That’s not the sort of wood I’m after today.”
</p>
<p>
    Oh merlin, how those words supplied Remus with such delicious  thoughts.
    Enough so that his surf-soaked trousers were becoming all too tight.
</p>
<p>
    How could Sirius fail to notice <em>that?</em> He grinned  lasciviously down
    at his husband knowingly. “On second thought, I think I’ll  stay right
    <em>here.</em>” Emphasizing the final word with a gentle cant of his hips.  Then he
    pressed himself forward until Remus was on his back, sand and sea  mussing
    up his hair with an incoming wave.
</p>
<p>
    Remus welcomed the heated kiss and would probably have  gone on further if
    not for the sudden interruption from Severus bringing him  out of his
    lustful haze.
</p>
<p>
    “Do you mind?” The Dark man snipped.
</p>
<p>
    “Not at all.” Sirius quipped without missing a beat, then  went right back
    to snogging his husband.
</p>
<p>
    Severus huffed. “I hardly think the locals would care to  witness the pair
    of you having sex right on the beach.”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, don’t be such a sodding prude.” Sirius growled  playfully.
</p>
<p>
    ‘A prude, am I? Well, I suppose my <em>services</em> are no  longer
    required. I’ll just go and pack then, shall I?” Severus made to stand  but
    was lunged at by Sirius who pushed him into the sand and snogged him
    senseless.
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t. You. Dare.” Sirius breathed against his lover’s  soft lips.
</p>
<p>
    Severus growled and flipped them over quickly, pressing  himself hard
    against the wild pureblood. “Is that a threat, Black?” He asked,  his tone
    deep and velvety.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius shivered and flipped them back over again. “It  could be.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus flipped them back again and pressed himself even  harder against his
    lover, reveling in the small gasp that escaped him. Oh, this  was getting
    out of hand, but he couldn’t care less anymore.
</p>
<p>
    Things might have progressed indecently, but Remus  cleared his throat,
    pulling them both from their less than chaste behaviour in  broad daylight.
    “I hate to break this up,” he said, unable to keep the huskiness  from his
    voice, “but the rain’s come in with that swell. If we don’t get under  cover
    soon, we’ll be caught in it, and I don’t fancy being soaked to the skin.”
</p>
<p>
    “Once again, love. Repelling charms…” Sirius intoned  before jumping up from
    between them and giving them both a fiendish look. “Right,  then.” He stated
    boldly, narrowing his eyes and grinning broadly. “Last one back  is a
    blast-ended skrewt!” he turned and sped off, his bare feet kicking up bits
    of sand as he fled.
</p>
<p>
    Severus pulled his wand out and raised it, but Remus  blocked it with his
    hand. “No hexing, remember?” He chided the prickly man sat  beside him.
    Severus glared at him and Remus grinned cunningly back. “But a  little
    pranking…” Severus mirrored his grin then.
</p>
<p>
    They got to their feet quickly and raced toward the pureblooded  menace
    taunting them over his shoulder as he continued to take the lead.  Severus
    just couldn’t help himself; Sirius was such an easy target. He flicked  his
    wand stealthfully at the man and the next moment Sirius was falling into a
    newly created hole just in front of him- not too deep mind, just up to his
    armpits, slowing him down enough that he’d soon be overtaken.
</p>
<p>
    Severus chuckled darkly and Remus smacked him on the arm. “I didn’t mean
    it like <em>that</em> you bastard!” But he was grinning like  an idiot all
    the same. They soon caught up with Sirius and helped him finish  climbing
    out of the hole with only a minuscule amount of foul language thrown  at
    Severus for his little trick. Laughter filled the air as the three,
    forty-something year old- not children at all- wizards continued jogging the
    remainder  of the path to the warm bungalow awaiting them. They made it just
    in time to  hear the deluged begin smattering against the old tin roof above
    their dry, albeit  sweaty-from-running heads. And the merry lovers were
    still laughing when a  familiar, screechy whistle startled them.
</p>
<p>
    “Hedwig!” Sirius cried. “What on earth are you doing  here?” She hopped
    towards him with another small whistle. “Did you come all the  way from
    London?” he asked her astonishedly. She held out her leg with a small
    parcel attached to it. “What’s this, then?” Sirius took the package and
    stroked  the feathers at the top of her head before offering her a bit of
    dried mango.  She clacked her bill at him reproachfully. “Sorry, love, but
    we weren’t  expecting company. If you wait a moment, Remus can get you a
    fresh piece.
</p>
<p>
    Remus nodded and went to fetch a knife, as well as a  large, ripe mango from
    the bowl on the table.
</p>
<p>
    Severus took both from him and proceeded to peel the  sticky-sweet fruit
    with the precision that could only be found in a lifetime of  brewing
    potions. Once it was perfectly sliced, he proffered a small piece to
    Hedwig.
</p>
<p>She turned her head away from him.</p>
<p>“Oh, go on. Have a bite.”</p>
<p>She eyed his warily, this was the man that had caused her master so many foul
    moods in years past after all.
</p>
<p>“How will you  ever know what you’re missing if you don’t try it first?”</p>
<p>Let it never be said  that Hedwig was not fearless. She hesitantly took the
    slice in the tip of her  beak and the tiniest bit of juice met her tongue.
    She devoured it in the next  moment, swiveling her head in the direction of
    the bowl as she eyed another tasty  piece.
</p>
<p>Severus chuckled at that. “Told you so.”</p>
<p>
    “What are the odds that Severus has spoiled her for any  other treat then?”
    Remus wondered aloud.
</p>
<p>
    Sirius barked a laugh. “I suppose we’ll need to write  Harry and tell him to
    be prepared for her return trip.”
</p>
<p>
    “Speaking of which…” Remus nodded questioningly at the  package that was now
    open, revealing a small silver box tied with emerald  ribbon.
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, yeah. It’s from Harry alright… A letter…” Sirius  said as he removed
    the missive from the box. “And… what the-?” He chuckled; his  brow furrowed
    in confusion.
</p>
<p>
    Severus watched him hand a framed photograph to Remus,  who also furrowed
    his brow and laughed, shaking his head. “What is it?” he asked curiously. Remus  handed him the
    frame next, and Severus looked down at it wondering what on  earth could
    cause them both to react in such a way. The next moment he burst  out
    laughing.
</p>
<p>
    Neither Sirius nor Remus had expected that. They both  looked at the letter
    then and Sirius read it aloud.
        “Padfoot- <em>that’s me</em>- Moony,  and Severus. Happiest of holidays to you!
        Everyone back home is getting on well.  Thank you for the wonderful
        gifts! I only wish we were all together to have  shared them on
        Christmas day. But I fully understand the need to have your  little
        ‘getaway’, and I couldn’t be happier for you. And speaking of gifts,
        Dobby was ever so pleased with the present that Severus gave him. He
        wailed for  nearly ten minutes before I could get him to calm down. In
        fact, he was so happy  that he discarded every other hat he owns.
        Hermione’s a little miffed, but I know  she’ll get over it. Anyway,
        Dobby has been driving me up the wall with his exuberance,  and I don’t
        have the heart to tell him off for it. Please consider coming back  to
        England early so I can have a minute of peace. Wishing you all well and
        a <em>speedy</em> return. Love, Harry."
</p>
<p>
    Severus chuckled again, still looking at the moving  photograph. Sirius and
    Remus joined him on either side and together they  watched the happiest elf
    in the world dancing round and round, twirling and  leaping with all his
    might. And on the top of his head was the largest, most  garish- entirely
    too big for him- lavender wide-brimmed Event hat adorned with sunflowers,
    cherries, and peacock feathers that anyone had ever seen.
</p>
<p>
    Remus put his arm around Severus, drawing him in even closer,  then he
    gently laid his head against the man’s shoulder. “You really are an old
    softy, you know that?”
</p>
<p>
    “I am nothing of the sort.” Severus interjected tersely.
</p>
<p>
    “It was very sweet of you.” Sirius laid his head against  Severus’ other
    shoulder.
</p>
<p>
    Severus huffed. “It was a means to an end, nothing more. A  sufficient
    distraction from his former duties to me.” They didn’t look very convinced.
    “I’ve left Hogwarts for good, and I don’t want to be bothered for the
    remainder  of my life by that little bugger following me around.”
</p>
<p>
    “Mmhmm.” Sirius hummed knowingly.
</p>
<p>
    “Did you fail to notice how revolting that hat is? Why  would I give him
    such a thing if I wasn’t please to be well shot of him?”  Severus snipped.
</p>
<p>
    Remus chuckled. “And did you fail to notice just how all  that clutter has
    compounded its worth to him? I have the feeling Dobby will be  popping in to
    thank you personally as soon as we return home.”
</p>
<p>
    Severus shut his eyes and half groaned, half sniggered  while shaking his
    head. The elf would probably be round for tea every damned  day. His
    companions pulled him even closer then, their proximity soothing  his
    vexed soul instantly. He sighed contentedly.
</p>
<p>
    “Home.” Sirius said wistfully, nuzzling against Severus’  cheek.
</p>
<p>
    “Home.” Remus sighed happily into Severus’ shoulder as he thought
    once more of the cozy little cottage awaiting the three of them in England.
</p>
<p>
    Severus inhaled deeply, yet again committing to memory  the intoxicating
    scent of both his lovers. He sighed peacefully, his eyes remaining  closed
    as a slight prickle fought its way through. The room was silent but for
    their continuous, measured breathing. “Home.” He said at last. And he meant
    it.

<p class="notes">
    <strong>End  Notes</strong>: Thank you all for  reading this story! I hope
    you have taken pleasure in every last minute of the Prickly Potions  Master and his
    adventure into
    <s>
        ‘settling down’
    </s>
    amorously-infused, high-spirited  domesticity with a couple of Old Marauders
    [or The Inevitable Thruple, as I like to refer to them]. There are
    several Easter Eggs  hidden in this story!  Two of them are  hopefully
    rather easy to recognize, one for the Alan Rickman
    fans, and one for the Dwarfers. Another of these is a reference  to Edgar
    Allan Poe’s ‘The Bells’ (hint: rhymes with…). Then there’s an  incredibly
    vague reference to a song by the Rifftones satirizing the Twilight  Series
    films. And perhaps the vaguest of all references ever would be to the
    ‘sparkly  pants’ in this story- which alludes to ‘Professor Snape
    Sparklepants’, a First  Discovery of mine from Infinite Craft. Do not ask me
    for the steps needed to  create such a thing for I cannot remember them. I
    was feeling rather insane  that day and took it upon myself to immortalize a
    sparkly Severus throughout the  ethernet. It did involve Spongebob
    Squarepants at some point though, if you  should ever feel so inclined as to
    attempt to recreate it, but I digress. I have also added a reference in the form of an
    historical figure, Agnes Sampson, who I felt deserved a Portrait of her very own
    after what she'd been put through. And finally, there is one unintentional reference
    to A Dandy in Aspic (film) with the ‘cut’ on Severus hand (he’s so much like Eberlin).
    [also: I had not seen the film prior to writing this story, so I find it
    rather uncanny that there should be so many similarities. Although that
    might  be me projecting a bit, especially since it’s easy to see Severus in
    Laurence  Harvey…]. I only realized the subconscious reference after
    completing the story. [If you haven’t seen the film, I highly recommend that you stop what you’re doing
    right this minute and go watch it!] If  you can find at least two of
    these references hidden throughout the story, you will  receive 10 points!…
    Didn’t spot them the first time through? Well, what are  you waiting for?
    Start over from the beginning and have another look. Go on, then. Enjoy!

    Icelandic: Askjan Bruggfélag = The Caldera Brewers Society<br>

    <strong>Rotuman Cultural References:</strong> I  chose to have our lovely
    Thruple be welcomed in the traditional Rotuman manner  when they visited the
    fictional wizard village of Tan hae Hefhefu. The ceremony,  called a mamasa,
    occurs when the person/people who left the island (forau) returns  from
    abroad or deep-sea fishing, but is also used to welcome visitors as well.
    The  word mamasa refers to ‘the act of drying a person that has been wet’ by
    the salty  sea spray. Part of the ceremony involves sitting on a special set
    of mats (päega),  being adorned by a garland of leaves and flowers (tefui),
    and feasting on foods  baked in an oven dug into the ground (koua).
