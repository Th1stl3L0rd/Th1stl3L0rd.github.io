    prompt of May 2025, set by @theawkwardartist13. This is merely the prologue
    for a much larger Fanfic. It will be epic and most likely reach 50k+ words,
    perhaps more, before its end. I am currently in the middle of writing a novel
    that takes up all my free time, so it may be quite a while before the remainder
    of this story is finished. You may contact me via DM @chocolate.n.cherries

<img class="pageBreak" src="../images/StarTrek_Page%20Break_Large_Transparent_Green2.png">


<p class="firstP" id="shadowSoulFirstP">
    Tuvok and T’Pel knelt at the altar, their fingers outstretched before them gently
    touching, their gaze upon each other resolute. The ancient hall surrounding them was
    silent but for their gentle breathing and the delicate whisper of robes or soft shoes
    as witnesses departed.
</p>
<p>The bonding ceremony was now complete.</p>
<p>No smiles. No laughter. Neither singing, nor dancing.</p>
<p>Those were human expressions.</p>
<p>Not something that Tuvok and his people would entertain lightly.</p>
<p>Their union had been the logical choice to make. But even without the complication of
    his sudden <em>Pon Farr,</em> Tuvok knew it was the correct path for his future.
</p>
<p>The Necklace.</p>
<p>T&rsquo;Pel had approached him only two short months ago. He had not known she would
    carry the tradition like their ancestors before them. It was not a requirement, and
    the practice had been abandoned by many in recent years. Perhaps it was this single
    element which cemented Tuvok&rsquo;s decision when she asked for his hand in marriage.
</p>
<p>She was the constant that would counter his &lsquo;frivolity&rsquo;, a grounding force
    to defeat the rumors of his imbalanced soul. To rebuild what had been shattered during
    his loss of control at the age of seventeen. Memories he chose to recall but rarely.
</p>
<p>He was not embarrassed.</p>
<p>He was not afraid.</p>
<p>Those were emotions.</p>
<p>Something that Vulcans, under the teachings of Surak, had divested themselves from
    long ago.</p>
<p>Tuvok buried those memories deep within his mind. A logical necessitation. They would
    have been a distraction from his duties otherwise. First within Starfleet Academy, then aboard
    the Excelsior, and now as a professor of Archery Science on his home planet.
</p>
<p>It was a harsh discipline. Years of astute observation and practical application were
    required to master the technique, to become an accomplished archer. The proper angle
    of the bow. The tension of the string. The duration and consequent endurance required
    to hold that stance for a prolonged period. Recognizing that the weight of your own
    mind compelled the truth of your aim. Mistakes could be costly with a fitted arrow
    eager for its target.
</p>
<p>The Institute of Defense had accepted his teaching request with minimal hesitation.
    Yet again, the obstacle being his younger self and his emotional irregularity. But
    Tuvok had overcome that moment of weakness. His control no longer wavered.
</p>
<p>Except during <em>Pon Farr.</em></p>
<p>The only acceptable time to become fractured. To fail in one&rsquo;s devotion to the
    higher path of Logic.
</p>
<p>In those moments Tuvok would meditate, but there was always a part of him that was
    incapable of completing the ritual. Of obtaining the enlightenment necessary for
    survival through such a grueling transformation of self. He could not suppress the
    urge for physical contact with another.
</p>
<p>His secret.</p>
<p>One of many&hellip;</p>
<p>Secrets were considered an element of weakness for his people. They hid the truth,
    propagated the colonization of lies.</p>
<p>Lies.</p>
<p>Vulcans cannot lie. But they can alter the truth when deemed necessary. A false-positive,
    a misdirection, a ruse that might lead someone in a circumventive direction while still
    allowing them to reach their perceived destination.
</p>
<p>It was necessary for Tuvok to withhold the truth, and for many reasons.</p>
<p>None of them easily explained.</p>
<p>He began his training in deception during his first <em>Pon Farr.</em> A time
    when no more than the brushing of fingers was required to satiate, to restore
    the neurochemical imbalance inflicted upon his people. And for many, including
    Tuvok, the initial cycle was remedied through meditation alone.
</p>
<p>At that age, the mind was eager to advance, to push beyond the trappings of
    the flesh, to ascend blindly but deftly towards the ultimate incarnation.
    The bodily needs were easier to suppress and ignore if one were disciplined
    enough. Left behind, but not forgotten, and reunited again on the return
    journey, or for some individuals, abandoned entirely for the remainder of
    their lives. For them, meditation was an impenetrable force against such a
    violent and sporadic phase.
</p>
<p>But Tuvok, though strong of will and successful in his first attempt, was
    plagued by an inkling of emotion&mdash;<em>Desire</em>&mdash;and he recognized
    this newfound sensation of <em>need</em>, of <em>longing</em> for what it truly
    was. Weakness. Something that, if not carefully avoided, could thrust him into
    a world of uncontrollable feelings. Coveting that transcendental attachment to
    another person at any moment and wanting nothing more than to dismiss his
    teachings outright in favor of his people&rsquo;s primitive ways. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>A tragedy that he would be forced to encounter every seven years.</p>
<p>Dread. That was the feeling which assaulted him most during his <em>Pon Farr.</em>
    And panic. Fear. Fear that he might lose control entirely and never regain it.
    He could not escape those horrid feelings and their damning thoughts. They
    lodged in the back of his mind, hushed voices conversing over his blatant
    failure as a Vulcan.
</p>
<p>Tuvok carried these voices with him beyond his first <em>Pon Farr,</em> through
    the majority of his teenage years. He never spoke of it to anyone. He could
    not admit to the possibility of it escalating into something abhorrent. But
    he remained in control, and as time went on, the voices faded.
</p>
<p>Until he fell in love with Jara and strayed from the path of Logic. Embraced
    those forbidden emotions. Renounced his teachings.
</p>
<p>His fears had become reality. He was a failure. Expelled from school. Sent
    to train under the eye of a Master to regain control. A four-month quest
    through the desert, his mind growing sharper than the small blade at his
    belt with every step he took. <em>Kolinahr.</em> Achieving the state of
    mind that would allow Tuvok to suppress all emotion. To become a true
    Vulcan.
</p>
<p>But with the arrival of his second <em>Pon Farr,</em> he was forced to
    recognize his faults once more. The onslaught of his emotional distress
    was more than he could bear, the sheer intensity overwhelming him in ways
    he never thought possible before.
</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t right.</p>
<p>His people did not undergo deep meditation and continue to face such
    things.
</p>
<p>Vulcans were stronger than that.</p>
<p>Tuvok locked himself away&mdash;locked his mind away&mdash;retreating from
    all others. Determined not to allow such turbulence, such unrelenting
    violent emotion to flow through him. But his meditation was not enough.
    He became a feral thing. Growling, snarling, screaming, beating his fists
    on the ground. <em>Hating</em> his vulnerability. And with each passing
    day the tendrils of Death drew closer to him, called to him. <em>Plok Tow.</em>
</p>
<p>On the sixth day, Tuvok gave in to the irrepressible urge and took a mate.
    The intimacy did not frighten him, nor that his partner was half-human.
    In that moment he could not think beyond the need for connection, to merge
    his mind and body with another. But afterwards, when the roiling of his
    instincts had subsided, his reflection terrified him.
</p>
<p>It was then that Tuvok knew just how deeply the vein of lies ran through
    his people. For how could they not know the severity of this experience
    for themselves. He could not be the only one to <em>feel</em> this way.
    To wish, to <em>beg</em> for the end of all emotions. For the silence
    to extend from his mind into his body and out through his soul!
</p>
<p>That was the true reason behind Surak and his people choosing the path
    of Logic and Peace. Not the Wars that arose with The Time of Awakening.
    Not the killing&mdash;the murder&mdash;for the right to mate that
    preceded it. They wanted to be rid of the pain, the suffering of
    unfathomable emotions. Tuvok was sure of it. No one would ever choose
    to feel such things if given the opportunity to flee from them.
</p>
<p><em>He could not be the only one.</em></p>
<p>It was his secret.</p>
<p>One of many&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;So many secrets.</p>
<p>Each new <em>Pon Farr</em> brought forth the same reaction for Tuvok.
    Each coupling, the harboring of new secrets. Of greater secrets. The
    complications surrounding them Paramount in the end.
</p>
<p>Before he left&hellip;</p>
<p>Returned to Vulcan.</p>
<p>Began a new life far away from those lies and secrets. Dangerous
    things&hellip; The decisions he was forced to make. To save lives.
    To save worlds. To save the entire Quadrant&hellip; with the help
    of another.
</p>
<p>Their secret&hellip;</p>
<p>One of many&hellip;</p>
<p>And tonight, T&rsquo;Pel would learn all of them. She would meld
    with him&mdash;mind, body, and soul. She would know. She would
    discover <em>Her&hellip;</em> &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Their talks, their letters. Whispered words in the dark, desperate
    moments he could not face in the light of day. Their struggle to
    right a most terrible and insidious wrong. To protect the future.
    To protect themselves.
</p>
<p>How would T&rsquo;Pel respond? Would she think him weak? Would she
    reject him? Would she forgive him for the lingering presence
    of <em>Her </em>in his mind?
</p>
<p>&hellip;In his heart?</p>
<p>His most coveted secret.</p>
