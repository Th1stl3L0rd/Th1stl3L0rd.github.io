    <h1>OtterMan</h1>
    <h2>The True Identity of Benedict Cumberbatch</h2>
    <p>This elusive creature can be found in many locations but is most often seen
    in his native territory of London, England. He is usually identified by his wide
    toothy grin, squinty nasal sneer, haunting laugh, and ferocious bellowing and
    hissing (the latter only during intense-acting season). These characteristics
    are what attract people the most and they have been known to search day
    and night for a chance of photographing him. His most loyal fans
    affectionately refer to him as "Otterbatch" or "Cumbotter" when speaking of
    him. "Look! There he goes with a latte!" or "He wears the
    same watch as me!" are some of the most common responses when
    sighted. However, sometimes he is mistaken for the equally elusive
    <a href="hedgeman.html">Hedgeman</a>, due to the fact that they maintain such a close friendship.
    Sceptics question his origins and dispute the vast collection of evidence.
    Although we only have a limited understanding of OtterMan and much of the
    research is still inconclusive, the true believers continue to spread the word.
    If the photos and stories below aren't enough to convince you of the
    existence of OtterMan then just remember one thing. If something quacks
        like a duck....</p>

            <p>Notice the severe agle of the jaw line and flared nostrils. The gleam in the eyes is uncanny and if you stare long enough you will see the depths of Hades. At this time, it is inconclusive as to whether or not the fangs have been cosmetically altered.</p>

            <p>The meditative stance is unmistakable. The change in eye color is thought to be mood related and the gasping is usually performed during moments of great epiphany.</p>

            <p>Great sadness is displayed rarely but when revealed to us can have a truly devastating effect. The frumpled chin and pouting lip are only seen when well-loved soap opera characters die.</p>
