                <h1 id="aboutUsHeader">About Us</h1>

                <p id="aboutUsP">Sesame Family Law is a premier divorce and family law practice serving clients
                    throughout New York. When families in transition face challenges that cannot be resolved in the
                    home, going to court may not be the best answer. The emotional and financial burden of a drawn-out
                    legal battle can weigh heavily on every member of the family, but children are especially
                    vulnerable. For this reason, it is wise to consult with an experienced family law attorney.
