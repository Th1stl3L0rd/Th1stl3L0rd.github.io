/*The original code was designed by Christopher Aue.*/
/*https://christopheraue.net/design/fading-pages-on-load-and-unload*/

/*I have adjusted the code to suit my personal preferences, but most of it remains in its original state.*/

/*YOU MUST USE:   <svg id="fader"></svg>    IN THE BODY OF THE HTML.*/
/*IT MUST BE THE FIRST LINE OF CODE OR THE EFFECT WILL NOT WORK!*/
/*YOU MUST IMPORT THIS css FILE: <link rel="stylesheet" href="page-fade-to-black.css"> INTO THE HEAD!*/
/*DO NOT FORGET TO IMPORT THE ACCOMPANYING JS FILE  < script src = "page-fade-to-black.js" > < /script>  IN THE HEAD!*/
/*THIS JS FILE MUST BE FIRST IN THE HEAD BEFORE ANY OTHER SCRIPT, UNLESS ANOTHER SCRIPT IN NECESSARY TO LOAD THE PAGE!*/

/*This CSS was finalized on April 12th 2025 by Trista Fedoruk*/
