            <a id="playerAeschylus" href="aeschylus_WitLibsJr.html">Aeschylus</a>   <!--php begin record onclick, record
            all data throughout so that it can record the proper save file, save file will output to the storybook page,
            use $varName = 'p #bearMountainP'; echo '.varName.'; to show the completed story p. it the php is working,
            it will record whoever makes the story correctly. so... onclick function recordAeschylus(),php echo/print
            can set a timeout for each player i think set it with a function that says if player returns to home page timeout
            that way it can start a new session if another or even same name is clicked. clear all tract data when return to
            homepage. also use readfile() to read whatever is saved. or fopen, fread, and fclose are a better option,
             can do more with it. use the r in fread for read only on the saved game files. SESSION must be set before
              anything else in the document, add this to each user page, so that when they click on their name on the
               home page it will take them to their page and start recording. i thin i need php json encode and decode
               so that the computer will recognize the player and save all the data. i think i need to make a function
               that says if onclick save then function converttojson () this function will turn the createstory data
               into json that can be read by php and stored as a text file into the storybook page, i think...
               oh, maybe i can just create a text file when the player creates the story initially and make a function
               that says if the save button is clicked it will save the text file, otherwise it will discard it.
               so... [onclick createstory(): convert output to textfile, onclick save: save textfile to storybook page(date/time
               and user log for each file saved)-->
