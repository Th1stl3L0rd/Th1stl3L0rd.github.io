<h1>Thy Thistle Lord's Secret Dungeon</h1>
    <a href="index.html">Escape!</a>
<p>Zounds! Ye have found my Secret Dungeon! I suppose you want to know all about me, eh? Well...</p>
<p>I enjoy long walks on the beach...</p>
<p>Oh, that's not what ye want?...</p>
<p>My favourite colour is purple...</p>
<p>Still not what ye want?...</p>
<p>Well, all I've got left is this little diatribe...</p>
<p>I'm just a wayward web developer, practicing me craft wherever the wind blows me. I'd never consider meself anything
more than a fledgling, though I've been known to do more than spread my wings occasionally. Flying's not really the
    tricky part, it's the falling that's such a pain. But I get right back up again and start over... well, sometimes
    I need a bit of a breather first, but I manage it all the same. Oh, I suppose you want to know about me projects
    and such. Just head back the way ye came, <em>if ye can...</em> There's no knowing for sure whether you'll make it
    back through the labyrinth of my mind. But I digress... Deep in the enchanted forest, ye will find ancient projects
    from my days as a young school boy. Don't mind the creatures, they don't bite, <em>usually.</em> If ye wander into
    the less-deep enchanted forest ye will find all the projects I'm currently experimenting with. There's lots of
loose magic about in there, but ye should be fine. Anyway, the final area holds me writing hut, and all the stories
    that have been published so far. There's a lot more where they came from to be sure.</p>
<p>Now, what are ye waiting for... get back there and do some proper exploring!</p>
